`Y` is a simple numeric matrix. `⎕FR` must be 645.


The result `R` is a 4 element vector whose elements are as follows.


| `[1]` | `U` | a unitary matrix |
| --- | --- | ---  |
| `[2]` | `S` | a diagonal matrix |
| `[3]` | `V` | a unitary matrix |
| `[4]` | `f` | a Boolean flag indicating whether the algorithm converged (1)or not (0) |


This function computes a factorisation of the matrix `Y` such that:
```apl
      Y ≡ U +.× S +.× ⍉+V
```


This can be useful for analysing matrices for which `⌹` cannot compute an inverse, because they are singular or nearly singular.

#### Note:


This function signals `DOMAIN ERROR` if `⎕FR` is 1287. See [Floating-Point Representation  on page 1](../../system-functions/system-functions-a-z/system-functions-a-z/fr.md).
