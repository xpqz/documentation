Under Windows the option, **Windows -> Close All Windows** allows the user to close all open Editor and Tracer Windows, but does not reset the **state indicator**.


This I-beam mimics this behaviour, thus allowing the user to write code which can close all windows before attempting to save the workspace; with the exception of calling `0 ⎕SAVE` it is not possible to save a workspace if any editor or tracer windows are open.


Under non-Windows operating systems this is the only mechanism for closing all such windows. This I-beam is effective in RIDE too.

#### Example
```apl

      2023⌶0    
```
