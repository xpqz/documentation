This command lists the names of Dyalog APL workspaces contained in the given directory.

#### Example
```apl
      )LIB WS
MYWORK TEMP
```


If a directory is not given, the workspaces on the user's APL workspace path (WSPATH) are listed.  In this case, the listing is divided into sections identifying the directories concerned.  The current directory is identified as "`.`".

#### Example
```apl
      )LIB
.
        PDTEMP  WORK   GRAPHICS
```
```apl
c:\Dyalog\ws
        display groups
```
