This function changes the size of a native file.


`Y` is a negative integer tie number associated with a tied native file.


`X` is a single integer value that specifies the new size of the file in bytes.  If `X` is smaller than the current file size, the file is truncated.  If `X` is larger than the current file size, the file is extended and the value of additional bytes is undefined.


The shy result of `⎕NRESIZE` is the tie number of the resized file.
