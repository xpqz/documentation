<h1 class="heading"><span class="name">Native File Move</span><span class="command">{R}←X ⎕NMOVE Y</span></h1>

This function moves native files and directories from one or more sources specified by `Y` to a destination specified by  `X`. `⎕NMOVE` is similar to `⎕NCOPY` (see Native File Copy  on page 1).


When possible `⎕NMOVE` *renames* files and directories, which effects a fast move when the source and destination are on the same file system. By default (see RenameOnly option below), if `⎕NMOVE` is unable to rename files or directories, it instead copies them and deletes the originals.


`X` is a character vector that specifies the name of the destination.


`Y` is a character vector that specifies the name of the source, or a vector of character vectors containing zero or more sources.


Sources and destinations may be full or relative (to the current working directory) path names adhering to the operating system convention.


If `Y` specifies more than one source, `X` must be a character vector  that specifies an existent directory to which each of the sources in `Y` is to be moved.


The shy result `R` contains count(s) of top-level items moved. If `Y` is a single source name, `R` is a scalar otherwise it is a vector of the same length as `Y`.


#### Variant Options


`⎕NMOVE` may be applied using the  Variant operator with the options Wildcard (the Principal option), IfExists, RenameOnly and ProcessCallback.


Note that when Wildcard is 1, element(s) of `R` can  be 0 or `>1`. If Wildcard is 0, elements of `R` are always 1.

#### IfExists Option


The IfExists variant option determines what happens when a source file is to be copied to a target file that already exists. It does not apply to directories, only to the files within them.


| Value | Description |
| --- | ---  |
| 'Error' | Existing files will not be overwritten and an error will be signalled. |
| `'Skip'` | Existing files will not be overwritten but the corresponding copy operation will be skipped (ignored). |


The following cases cause an error to be signalled  regardless of the value of the IfExists variant.

- If the source specifies a directory and the destination specifies an existing file.
- If the source specifies a file and the same base name exists as a sub-directory in the destination.
#### RenameOnly Option (Boolean)


The RenameOnly option  determines what happens when it is not possible to rename the source.


| 0 | The source will be copied and the original deleted |
| --- | ---  |
| `1` | The move will fail |


#### Examples


A number of possibilities exist, illustrated by the following examples. In all cases, if the source is a file, the file is moved. If the source is a directory, the directory and all of its contents are moved.

##### Examples (single source, Wildcard is 0)

- The source name must be an existent file or directory.
- If the destination name does not exist but its path name does exist, the source is moved to the destination name.
- If the destination name is an existing directory the source name is moved to that directory.```apl

```


##### Examples (single source, Wildcard is 1)

- The source name may include wildcard characters which matches a number of existing files and/or directories. The destination name must be an existing directory.
- The files and/or directories that match the pattern specified by the source name are moved into the destination directory. If there are no matches, zero copies are made.```apl

```



##### Examples (multiple sources, Wildcard is 0)

- Each source name must specify a single file or directory which must exist. The destination name must be an existing directory.
- Each of the files and/or directories specified by the source base names are moved to the destination directory.```apl

```



##### Examples (multiple sources, Wildcard is 1)

- The destination name must be an existing directory.
- Each of the files and/or directories that match the patterns specified by the source names (if any) are moved to the destination directory.```apl

#### Note


When `⎕NMOVE` copies and deletes files:

- The operation will take longer to complete.
- File modification times will be preserved but other attributes such as file ownership may be changed.
- Read permissions will be needed on all files within a directory which is moved.
- If the operation fails at any point and an error is signalled it is possible that there may be files and/or directories left duplicated in both the source and destination. It is not possible that a file or directory may be removed from the source without having been copied to the destination.

#### Wildcard Option (Boolean)


| 0 | The name or names in `Y` identifies a specific file name. |
| --- | ---  |
| `1` | The name or names in `Y` that specify the **base name** and **extension** (see NParts on page 1 ), may also contain the wildcard characters "?" and "*". An asterisk is a substitute for any 0 or more characters in a file name or extension; a question-mark is a substitute for any single character. |

#### ProgressCallback Option

#### Overview


If this option is enabled, the system function invokes an APL callback function as the file operation (move or copy) proceeds. A system object is used to communicate between the system function and the callback. The file operation has 4 distinct stages.

1. The start of the operation. The callback is invoked before any files are scanned or processed. This gives the application the opportunity to set parameters that control the frequency of callbacks during the operation itself.
2. The scan phase during which the system function enumerates the files that will be involved in the copy or move operation. The file count obtained is used to set the `Limit` field. The application may use this subsequently to indicate the degree of progress.
3. The main processing (move or copy) of the files.
4. The end of the operation.

The callback function is invoked once at the start of the operation, during the scan and processing stages, and finally once at the end of the operation. During the scan and processing stages, the frequency with which the callback is invoked is controlled by a combination of the `Delay` and `Skip` options.


The value of the ProgressCallback variant option may be:


| `fn` | The name of the callback function. |
| --- | ---  |
| `fn data` | The name of the callback function, and an array or namespace which is to be passed to the callback in its left argument. |



The right argument given to the callback function is a 3-element vector:


| `[1]` | Function | Character vector which identifies the function that caused the callback to be executed; either `'⎕NCOPY'` or `'⎕NMOVE'` |
| --- | --- | ---  |
| `[2]` | Event | Character vector describing the event that lead to the callback being executed. See below. |
| `[3]` | Info | Reference to a namespace containing information about the event. See below. |


#### Event



Event is a character vector which indicates the stage of the copy or move operation..


| `'Start'` | Reported by the first invocation of the callback which occurs before any files are scanned or processed. This may be used to set the parameters that control the operation. See Options on page 1 . |
| --- | ---  |
| `'Scan'` | Indicates that the system function is in the initial phase of scanning the files in order to calculate `Limit` . See ScanFirst on page 1 . |
| `'Progress'` | Indicates that the system function is at the main stage of the operation and is moving or copying the files. |
| `'Done'` | Indicates that all files have been processed. |



Note that there will always be at least 2 invocations of the callback to indicate the start and end of the operation.


#### Info


Info is a ref to a namespace that contains information about the event. This namespace persists for the duration of the execution of the system function and contains the following fields:


| `Progress` | A number between `0` and `Limit` . When the event code is `'Start'` , `Progress` is `0` . Every time a file or directory is processed, `Progress` is increased by 1. Finally when the  event code is `'Done'` , `Progress` will be equal to `Limit` . |
| --- | ---  |
| `Limit` | The maximum value of `Progress` . This value might change during the file operation if it doesn't do a full discovery first (the `ScanFirst` option is 0), or if the file structure changes between the scan and the copy/move. |
| `Last` | A vector of file names which have been processed since the last invocation of the callback function. The user can specify the maximum length of this vector by setting the `LastFileCount` option. The names in this list are the source names, and not the destination names. The `Last` vector is always empty when the event is `'Start'` , and it is cleared when going from the `'Scan'` phase to the `'Progress'` phase, to avoid any confusion. |
| `Data` | A field that is reserved for the user to store data which persists between invocations of the callback. It could for example be used to keep a sequence number, to count the number of times the callback had been run. |
| `Options` | This is a namespace which contains the information that controls the future execution of the callback. The options persist between the calls to the callback, so there is no need to set them again unless they should be changed. The fields and their default values are described below. |



#### Options


This is a namespace which contains options that control future invocations of the callback. The options persist between these invocations, so there is no need to set them again unless they should be changed. The fields and their default values are:


| Field | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | ---  |
| `ScanFirst` | 1 | Specifies if the file operation should do a "scan pass" before moving/copying the files. This stage just enumerates  the files to determine how many there are. This will ensure `Limit` has a realistic value when the actual processing of the files happens. The overhead is small in comparirsion with the time it takes to process the files. The `ScanFirst` field is only inspected right after the first invocation of the callback function, with the event code `'Start'` . |
| `Delay` | 0 | Specifies the number of milliseconds to wait, until the callback will be called again. If the entire file operation finishes before this time, the callback function is called anyway, with the event code `'Done'` . If a slow file operation is happening (such as copying a big file), the actual delay before the callback is invoked might be longer than the value of `Delay` . |
| `Skip` | 0 | Specifies a number of files to skip between invocations of the callback function. If you are only interested in getting a callback for each 10th file, you should set this option to 9 for example. |
| `LastFileCount` | 1 | An integer, specifying the maximum number of the latest filenames to be stored in the `Last` field. The default is to only store the last file processed, but if `Delay` or `Skip` are non-zero, multiple files could have been processed between calls to the callback function. A value of 5 for example, will make sure that the 5 last files processed before calling the callback, will have their names in the `Last` field. The `Last` field might have fewer elements than `LastFileCount` , if the number of files processed since the last call is less than `LastFileCount` .The special value `¯1` indicates that the `Last` field should contain **all** the last files since the last call (no limit). |



The result of the callback function must be a Boolean scalar, indicating whether or not the `⎕NCOPY` or `⎕NMOVE` should continue or stop.


1: Execution should continue.


0: Execution should stop. In this case, an `INTERRUPT` (event 1003) is signaled.
