`⎕SE` is a system namespace.  Its GUI components (MenuBar, ToolBar, and so forth) define the appearance and behaviour of the APL Session window and may be customised to suit individual requirements.


`⎕SE` is maintained separately from the active workspace and is not affected by `)LOAD` or `)CLEAR`.  It is therefore useful for containing utility functions.  The contents of `⎕SE` may be saved in and loaded from a .DSE file.


See [The Session Object on page 1](../../UserGuide/The%20APL%20Environment/Session%20Object.htm#Session%20Object) for further details.
