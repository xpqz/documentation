`Y` may be any numeric array.


Where an element of `Y` is real, the corresponding element of `R` is an integer whose value indicates whether the value is negative (`¯1`), zero (`0`) or positive (`1`).


Where an element of `Y` is complex, the corresponding element of `R` is a number with the same phase but with magnitude (absolute value) 1. It is equivalent to `Y÷|Y`.
