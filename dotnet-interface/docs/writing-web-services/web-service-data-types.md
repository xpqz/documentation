# Web Service Data Types

In principle, Web Services are designed to support most, if not all, of the data types supported by the .NET Framework, and to support any new .NET classes that you choose to define.

In practice, the current set of data types supported by Web Services is somewhat restricted; in particular:

- Multi-dimensional arrays are not supported; only vectors.
- Arbitrary nested arrays are not supported.

However, despite these restrictions, it is possible to build effective Web Services, as you will see in the following examples.
