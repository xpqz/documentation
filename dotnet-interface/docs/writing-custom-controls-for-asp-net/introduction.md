# Introduction

The previous chapter showed how you can build ASP.NET Web Pages by combining APL code with the Web Controls provided in the .NET Namespace System.Web.UI.WebControls. These controls are in fact just ordinary .NET classes. In particular, they are extensible components that can be used to develop more complex controls that encapsulate additional functionality.

This chapter describes how you can go about building custom server-side controls, for deployment in ASP.NET Web Pages.

A custom control is simply a .NET class that inherits from the Control class in the .NET Namespace System.Web.UI, or inherits from a higher class that is itself based upon the Control class. Like any other .NET class, a custom control is implemented in an assembly, physically as a DLL file. This chapter explores three different ways to implement a custom control.

The Control class provides a Render method whose job is to generate the HTML that defines appearance of the control. The first example, the SimpleCtl control, overrides the Render method to display a simple string "Hello World" in the browser.

The TemperatureConverterCtl1 control is an example of a compositional control, i.e. one that is composed of other standard controls packaged with special functionality. The TemperatureConverterCtl2 control, uses the basic approach of the SimpleCtl control, but provides the same functionality as TemperatureConverterCtl1. The TemperatureConverterCtl3 control illustrates how to generate events for the hosting page to catch and process.

These examples, which are based upon a series of articles called **Advanced ASP.NET Server-Side Controls** by George Shepherd that appeared in the **msdn magazine** (October 2000, January 2001 and March 2001 issues), are implemented as Dyalog classes in a namespace called `DyalogSamples` in the workspace samples\asp.net\temp\bin\temp.dws. The corresponding .NET Assembly samples\asp.net\temp\bin\temp.dll was generated from this workspace.
```apl
      )LOAD "C:\Program Files (x86)\Dyalog\Dyalog APL 15.0 Unicode\Samples\asp.net\temp\bin\temp.dws"
