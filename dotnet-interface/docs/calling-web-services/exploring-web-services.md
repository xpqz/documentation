# Exploring Web Services

You can use the Workspace Explorer to browse the proxy class associated with a Web Service, in exactly the same way that you can browse any other .NET Assembly. The following screen shots show the *Metadata* for LoanService, loaded from the LoanService.dll proxy.

Remember, LoanService was written in APLScript, but it appears and behaves just like any other .NET class.

The first picture displays the structure of the LoanResult class.

The second picture shows the methods exposed by LoanService. In addition to CalcPayments, which was written in APLScript, there are a large number of other methods, which have been inherited from the base class.
