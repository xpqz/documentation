# Example 1

This example illustrates data binding using XAML to specify the user-interface coupled with an APL function to drive it and handle the data binding.

## The XAML

The XAML shown below, describes a Window containing a TextBox.
```apl
<Window
 xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
 xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
 Name="Temp"
 Title="Data Binding (Text)"
 SizeToContent="WidthandHeight">
     <TextBox Name="txt" Width="300" Margin="5"
      Text="{Binding txtSource,Mode=TwoWay,
             UpdateSourceTrigger=PropertyChanged}"/>
</Window>
```

It contains a data binding expression, namely:
```apl
      Text="{Binding txtSource,Mode=TwoWay,
             UpdateSourceTrigger=PropertyChanged}"
```

This specifies that the Text property of the `TextBox` is bound to a value in the Binding Source (which has yet to be defined) whose path is txtSource. The binding mode is set to TwoWay which means that any change in the `TextBox` will be reflected in a new value in the Binding Source, and vice-versa. The value in the Binding Source will be updated when the property (in this case the Text Property) changes.

## The APL Code

The function `Text` which generates this example is shown below.

The argument `txt` is the text to be displayed initially in the `TextBox`. Note that the variable `XAML_Text` contains the XAML that describes the user-interface listed above.

```apl
     ∇ Text txt;⎕USING;str;xml;win
[1]    ⎕USING←,⊂'System.Windows.Controls,WPF/PresentationFramework.dll'
[2]    win←LoadXAML XAML
[3]    win.txtBox←win.FindName⊂'txt'
[4]
[5]    ⎕EX'txtSource'
[6]    txtSource←txt
[7]    win.txtBox.DataContext←2015⌶'txtSource'
[8]
[9]    win.Show
     ∇

```

The utility function `LoadXAML` incorporates the 3 lines of code, used to create a WPF window from XAML, that were coded in-line in previous examples in this chapter.
```apl
     ∇ win←LoadXAML xaml;⎕USING;str;xml
[1]    ⎕USING←'System.IO'
[2]    ⎕USING,←⊂'System.Windows.Markup'
[3]    ⎕USING,←⊂'System.Xml,system.xml.dll'
[4]    ⎕USING,←⊂'System.Windows.Controls,
                 WPF/PresentationFramework.dll'
[5]    str←⎕NEW StringReader(⊂xaml)
[6]    xml←⎕NEW XmlTextReader str
[7]    win←XamlReader.Load xml
     ∇

```

`Text[1]` defines the .NET search path needed to access the WPF controls.
```apl

[1]    ⎕USING←,⊂'System.Windows.Controls,WPF/PresentationFramework.dll'
```

`Text[2-3]` uses the utility function`LoadXAML` to load a WPF user-interface from the XAML and then uses the FindName method to obtain a reference to the object named **txt**.
```apl

[2]    win←LoadXAML XAML
[3]    win.txtBox←win.FindName⊂'txt'
```

`Text[5-6]` initialise a new global variable named `txtSource` to the value of the argument. When using a *global* variable as a data binding source, it is generally advisable to establish a new variable by first expunging it. This is because its binding type (the exported type of the data bound variable) is stored in the workspace along with its value, and the binding type (were it to be incorrect) may not  be changed once it has been established.
```apl

[5]   ⎕EX'txtSource'
[6]   txtSource←txt
```

`Text[7]`creates a Binding Source object using `2015⌶` and assigns it to the DataContext property of the `TextBox` object. Because it is a character vector, the exported Type for the bound variable`txtSource` is `System.String` which is appropriate for the Text property of a `TextBox`.
```apl

[7]    win.txtBox.DataContext←2015⌶'txtSource'
```

`Text[9]` displays the Window. Note that although the APL local variable `win` goes out of scope when the function terminates, the Window remains visible until the user has closed it.
```apl

[9]   win.Show
```

## Testing the Data Binding

The following expressions may be used to explore the effect of data binding.
```apl
      )LOAD wpfintro
      )CS DataBinding.Text
```
```apl
      Text 'Hello World'
```
```apl
![data binding text xaml 1](../img/data-binding-text-xaml-1.png)
```
```apl
     txtSource←⌽txtSource
```
```apl
![data binding text xaml 2](../img/data-binding-text-xaml-2.png)
```

Typing into the TextBox changes the value of the bound variable.
```apl
![data binding text xaml 3](../img/data-binding-text-xaml-3.png)
```
```apl
      txtSource
What is in txtSource now?

```
