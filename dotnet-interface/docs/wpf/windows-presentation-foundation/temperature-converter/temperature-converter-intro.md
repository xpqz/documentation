# Temperature Converter Tutorial

This tutorial illustrates how to go about developing a simple WPF application in Dyalog APL. It is functionally identical to the GUI tutorial example that illustrates how to develop a GUI application using the built-in Dyalog APL Graphical User Interface. See 
Interface Guide: 

GUI Tutorial.

Like the GUI Tutorial, this is necessarily an elementary example, but illustrates the principles that are  involved. The example is a simple Temperature Converter.

The user may enter a temperature value in either Fahrenheit or Centigrade and have it converted to the other scale.

No attempt has been made to update the WPF example, in terms of its user-interface, from the original version which was developed for Windows 3. This allows a direct comparison to be made between using the WPF and using the built-in Dyalog GUI.

There are two versions provided. The first uses XAML to describe the user-interface with code to drive it. The second version is written entirely in APL code. The two versions of this example may be found in WPFIntro.dws in the namespaces `UsingXAML` and `UsingCode` respectively.
