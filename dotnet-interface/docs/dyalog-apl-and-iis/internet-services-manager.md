# Internet Services Manager

As its name suggests, Internet Services Manager is a tool for managing IIS. If you are developing Web Pages and/or Web Services, you will be using this tool a lot, and it makes sense to add it as a shortcut on your desktop.

To do this, open **Control Panel**, then open **Administrative Tools**, right-click **Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager**, and select **Send To Desktop (create shortcut)**.
