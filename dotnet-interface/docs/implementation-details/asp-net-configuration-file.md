# The web.config file

ASP.NET configuration parameters are defined in a file named `web.config` located in or above the root directory of an ASP.NET application. Parameters defined in these files supplement or override ASP.NET parameters which are defined system-wide.

The `web.config` file provided with Dyalog is located in the Dyalog sub-directory `samples\asp.net` and applies to all the examples residing in child directories of this directory. If you create a Dyalog ASP.NET application elsewhere on your system, you will need to copy this `web.config` into the application root directory. The parameters defined in the Dyalog `web.config` file are described below. Further details are provided in comments in the file.

### DyalogBinDirectory

This specifies the full path to the Dyalog binaries (DLLs and script compiler).

### dyalog (compiler)

This section defines an ASP.NET language named `dyalog` so that the expression  `Language = "dyalog"` in a script file associates that script with the Dyalog APLScript compiler dyalogc.exe. Subsidiary parameters and keys for the dyalog compiler are:

| debug | "true" (default) or "false" to bind the script to the Development DLL or the Run-time DLL |
| --- | ---  |
| DyalogCompilerEncoding | "classic" or "unicode".. |
| DyalogCompilerOptions | This is used to define options for the script compiler. For example, to set `[]WX` to 1 use "/wx:1". |
| DyalogCompilerEmitPragmas | Must be "true" if you are using workspace behind. |

### DyalogIsolationMode

This parameter specifies the isolation method. See [Isolation Mode on page 1](Isolation Mode.htm#Isolation_Mode) for further details.

DyalogCacheDirectory may be used to define the directory used to save the cached files.
