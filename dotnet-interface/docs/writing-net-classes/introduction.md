# Introduction

Dyalog APL allows you to build new .NET Classes, components and controls. .NET classes created by Dyalog may be hosted by any application or programming language that supports .NET.

A component is a class with emphasis on cleanup and containment and implements specific interfaces.

A control is a component with user interface capabilities.

With one exception, every .NET Class inherits from exactly one base class. This means that it begins with all of the behaviour of the base class, in terms of the base class properties, methods and events. You add functionality by defining new properties, methods and events on top of those inherited from the base class or by overriding base class methods with those of your own.
