# Prerequisites

The Dyalog version {{ version_majmin }} .NET Framework interface requires version 4.0 or greater of Microsoft .NET Framework. It does *not* operate with earlier versions of the .NET Framework. In addition:

- .NET Framework version 4.5 is needed for full Data Binding support (including support for the `INotifyCollectionChanged` interface, which is used by Dyalog to notify a data consumer when the contents of a variable, that is data bound as a list of items, changes).
- .NET Framework version 4.6 is needed to run the Syncfusion libraries supplied with Dyalog version {{ version_majmin }}.
- IIS needs to be installed to access the examples in the Samples/asp.net sub-directory â€“ if IIS and ASP.NET are not present, the asp.net sub-directory will not be installed during the Dyalog installation.

Note that .NET Framework is specific to Microsoft Windows; the cross-platform .NET is also supported (see below).
