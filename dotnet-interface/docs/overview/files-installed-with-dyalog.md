# Files Installed with Dyalog

### NET Interface Components

The components used to support the .NET interface are summarised below. Different versions of each component are supplied  according to the target platform.

- The Bridge DLL. This is the interface library through which all calls between Dyalog APL and the .NET Framework are processed
- The DyalogProvider DLL. This DLL performs the initial processing of an `APLScript`.
- The *APLScript* Compiler. This is itself  written in Dyalog APL and packaged as an executable.
- The DyalogNet DLL; a subsidiary library
- The Dyalog DLL.Â This is the engine that executes all APL code that is hosted by and called from another .NET application.
