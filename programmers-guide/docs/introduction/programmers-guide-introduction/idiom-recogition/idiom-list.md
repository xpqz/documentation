# Idiom List

In the following table, arguments to the idiom have types and ranks as follows:

| Type | Description | Rank | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | ---  |
| `C` | Character | `S` | Scalar or 1-item vector |
| `B` | Boolean | `V` | Vector |

| `X` | any type | `` |  |

For example: `NV`: numeric vector, `CM`: character matrix, `PV`: nested vector.

## Notes

`/⍳` and `/⍳⍴`, as well as providing an execution time advantage, reduce intermediate workspace usage and, consequently, the incidence of memory compactions and the likelihood of a `WS FULL`.

`NA⊃¨⊂XV` is implemented as `XV[NA]`, which is significantly faster. The two are equivalent but the former now has no performance penalty.

`,/` is special-cased only for vectors of vectors or scalars. Otherwise, the expression is evaluated as a series of concatenations. Recognition of this idiom turns **join** from an *n-squared* algorithm into a linear one. In other words, the improvement factor is proportional to the size of the argument vector.

`⊃⌽` and `⊃⌽,` now take constant time. Without idiom recognition, the time taken depends linearly on the number of items in the argument.

`0=≡` takes a small constant time. Without idiom recognition, the time taken would depend on the size and depth of the argument, which in the case of a deeply nested array could be significant.

`↓⍉↑` is special-cased only for a vector of nested vectors, each of whose items is of the same length.

`{(↓⍺)⍳↓⍵}` can accommodate much larger matrices than its constituent primitives. It is particularly effective when bound with a left argument using the compose operator:
```apl
      find←mat∘{(↓⍺)⍳↓⍵}     ⍝ find rows in mat table
```

In this case, the internal hash table for `mat` is retained so that it does not need to be generated each time the monadic derived function `find` is applied to a matrix argument.

`{(∨\' '≠⍵)/⍵}` and `{(+/^\' '=⍵)↓⍵}` are two codings of the same idiom. Both use the same C code for evaluation.

`~∘' '¨↓` typically takes a character matrix argument and returns a vector of character vectors from which all blanks have been removed. An example might be the character matrix of names returned by the system function `⎕NL`. In general, this idiom accommodates character arrays of any rank.

`{(+/∨\' '≠⌽⍵)↑¨↓⍵}` typically takes a character matrix argument and returns a vector of character vectors. Any embedded blanks in each row are preserved but trailing blanks are removed. In general, this idiom accommodates character arrays of any rank.

`⊃∘⍴¨A` (`⎕ML<2`) and `↑∘⍴¨A` (`⎕ML>2`) avoid having to create an intermediate nested array of shape vectors.

For an array of vectors, this idiom quickly returns a *simple array* of the length of each vector.
```apl
      ⊃∘⍴¨ 'Hi' 'Pete' ⍝ Vector Lengths
2 4
```

For an array of matrices, it returns a simple array of the number of rows in each matrix.
```apl
      ⊃∘⍴¨⎕CR¨↓⎕NL 3   ⍝ Lines in functions
5 21...
```

`A,←A` and `A⍪←A` optimise the catenation of an array to another array along the last and first dimension respectively.

Among other examples, this idiom optimises repeated catenation of a scalar or vector to an existing vector.
```apl
      props,←⊂ 'Posn' 0 0
      props,←⊂'Size' 50 50
      vector,←2+4
```

Note that the idiom is not applied if the value of vector `V` is shared with another symbol in the workspace, as illustrated in the following examples:

Example 1: the idiom is used to perform the catenation to `V1`.
```apl
      V1←⍳10
      V1,←11
```

Example 2: the idiom is not used to perform the catenation to `V1`, because its value is at that point shared with `V2`.
```apl
      V1←⍳10
      V2←V1
      V1,←11
```

Example 3: the idiom is not used to perform the catenation to `V` in `Join[1]` because its value is, at that point, shared with the array used to call the function.
```apl
     ∇ V←V Join A
[1]    V,←A
     ∇
      (⍳10) Join 11
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
```

`⊢⌿XA`, `⊢/XA`, `⊣⌿XA`, and `⊣/XA` return the first/last rank `(0⌈¯1+⍴⍴A)` sub-array along the first/last axis of `XA`. For example, if `V` is a vector, then:

| `⊣/V` | First item of vector |
| --- | ---  |
| `⊢/V` | Last item of vector |

Similarly, if `M` is a matrix, then:

| `⊣⌿M` | First row of matrix |
| --- | ---  |
| `⊣/M` | First column of matrix |
| `⊢⌿M` | Last row of matrix |
| `⊢/M` | Last column of matrix |

The idiom generalises uniformly to higher-rank arrays.

**Euler's idiom** `*○NA` produces accurate results for right argument values that are a multiple of `0J0.5`. This is so that Euler's famous identity `0=1+*○0J1` holds, despite pi being represented as a floating point number.

For clarification; `XA↓⍨←NS`. If `NS` is `¯3` then the idiom removes the last `-¯3` (i.e. 3) items.

The idiom `XM1{(↓⍺)⍳↓⍵}XM2` is still recognised, but since Version 14.0 is no faster than `XM1⍳XM2`.
