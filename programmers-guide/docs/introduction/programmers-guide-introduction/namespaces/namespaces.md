# Namespaces

Namespace is a (class 9) object in Dyalog APL. Namespaces are analogous to
nested workspaces.
```apl
'Flat' APL Workspace      Workspace with Namespaces
.OLD-------------------.   .NEW-------------------.
|                      |   | FOO MAT VEC          |
| DISPLAY              |   | .Util----------.     |

They provide the same sort of facility for workspaces as directories do for
filesystems. The analogy, based on DOS, might prove helpful:

| Operation | Windows | Namespace |
| --- | --- | ---  |
| Create | mkdir | `)NS or ⎕NS` |
| Change | cd | `)CS or ⎕CS` |
| Relative name | dir1\dir\file | `NS1.NS2.OBJ` |
| Absolute name | \file\file | `#.NS.OBJ` |
| Name separator | \ | `.` |
| Top (root) object | \ | `#` |
| Parent object | .. | `##` |

#### Namespaces bring a number of major benefits:

They provide lexical (as opposed to dynamic) local names. This means that a
defined function can use local variables and functions which persist when it
exits and which are available next time it is called.

Just as with the provision of directories in a filing system, namespaces
allow us to organise the workspace in a tidy fashion. This helps to promote an
object oriented programming style.

#### APL's traditional name-clash problem is ameliorated in several ways:

- Workspaces can be arranged so that there are many fewer names at each namespace level. This means that when copying objects from saved workspaces there is a much reduced chance of a clash with existing names. 
- Utility functions in a saved workspace may be coded as a single namespace and therefore on being copied into the active workspace consume only a single name. This avoids the complexity and expense of a solution which is sometimes used in 'flat' workspaces, where such utilities dynamically fix local functions on each call.
- In flat APL, workspace administration functions such as `WSDOC` must share names with their subject namespace. This leads to techniques for trying to avoid name clashes such as using obscure name prefixes like '`⍙⍙L1`' This problem is now virtually eliminated because such a utility can operate exclusively in its own namespace.
#### The programming of GUI objects is considerably simplified.

- An object's callback functions may be localised in the namespace of the object itself.
- Static variables used by callback functions to maintain information between calls may be localised within the object.

This means that the object need use only a single name in its namespace.
