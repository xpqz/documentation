# Specification of Variables

A variable is a named array.  An undefined name or an existing variable may be assigned an array by specification with the left arrow (`←`).

## Examples
```apl
      A←'CHIPS WITH EVERYTHING'
      A
CHIPS WITH EVERYTHING

      X Y←'ONE' 'TWO'
      X
ONE
      Y
TWO
```
