<h1 class="heading"><span class="name">TIMEOUT</span><span class="command">1006</span></h1>

This report is given when the time limit specified by the system variable `⎕RTL` is exceeded while awaiting input through character input (`⍞`) or `⎕SR`.


It is also reported by `⎕FHOLD` if it times out.


It is usual for this error to be trapped.

#### Example
```apl
      ⎕RTL←5 ⋄ ⍞←'RESPOND WITHIN 5 SECONDS: ' ⋄ R←⍞
RESPOND WITHIN 5 SECONDS:
TIMEOUT
      ⎕RTL←5 ⋄ ⍞←'RESPOND WITHIN 5 SECONDS: ' ⋄ R←⍞
                                                  ^
```
