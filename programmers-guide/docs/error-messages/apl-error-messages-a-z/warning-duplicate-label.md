<h1 class="heading"><span class="name">warning duplicate label</span></h1>

This warning message is reported on closing definition mode when one or more labels are duplicated in the body of the defined function.  This does not prevent the definition of the function in the active workspace.  The value of a duplicated label is the lowest of the line-numbers in which the labels occur.
