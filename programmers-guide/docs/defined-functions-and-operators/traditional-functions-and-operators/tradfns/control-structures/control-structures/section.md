Functions and scripted objects (classes, namespaces etc.) can be subdivided into Sections with `:Section` and `:EndSection` statements. Both statements may be followed by an optional and arbitrary name or description. The purpose is to split the function up into sections that you can open and close in the Editor, thereby aiding readability and code management. Sections have no effect on the execution of the code, but must follow the nesting rules of other control structures.
