[Formal Definition](With%20Statement%20Definition.htm)



`:With` is a control structure that may be used to simplify a series of references to an object or namespace. `:With` changes into the specified namespace for the duration of the control structure, and is terminated by `:End[With]`. `obj` is either the name of or a reference to a namespace. For example, you could update several properties of a Grid object `F.G` as follows:

```apl
       :With F.G
            Values←4 3⍴0
            RowTitles←'North' 'South' 'East' 'West'
            ColTitles←'Cakes' 'Buns' 'Biscuits'
       :EndWith
```




`:With` is analogous to `⎕CS` in  the following senses:

- The namespace argument to `:With` is interpreted relative to the current space.
- With the exception of those with name class  9, local names in the containing defined function continue to be visible in the new space.
- Global references from within the `:With` control structure are to names in the new space. 
- Exiting the defined function from within a `:With` control structure causes the space to revert to the one from which the function was called.


On leaving the `:With` control structure, execution reverts to the original namespace. Notice however that the interpreter does not detect branches `(→)` out of the control structure. `:With` control structures can be nested in the normal fashion:
```apl
[1]   :With 'x'           ⍝ Change to #.x
[2]       :With 'y'       ⍝ Change to #.x.y
[3]           :With ⎕SE   ⍝ Change to ⎕SE
[4]               ...     ⍝ ... in ⎕SE
[5]           :EndWith    ⍝ Back to #.x.y
[6]       :EndWith        ⍝ Back to #.x
[7]   :EndWith            ⍝ Back to #


```
