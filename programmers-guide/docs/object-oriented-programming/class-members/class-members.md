# Class Members

A Class may contain *Methods*, *Fields*and *Properties* (commonly referred to together as *Members*) which are defined within the body of the Class script or are inherited from other Classes.

Methods are regular APL defined functions, but with some special characteristics that control how they are called and where they are executed. Dfns may not be used as Methods.

Fields are just like APL variables. To get the Field value, you reference its name; to set the Field value, you assign to its name, and the Field value is stored *in* the Field. However, Fields differ from variables in that they possess characteristics that control their accessibility.

Properties are similar to APL variables. To get the Property value, you reference its name; to set the Property value, you assign to its name. However, Property values are actually accessed via *PropertyGet* and *PropertySet* functions that may perform all sorts of operations. In particular, the value of a Property is not stored *in* the Property and may be entirely dynamic.

All three types of member may be declared as *Public* or *Private* and as *Instance* or *Shared*.

Public members are visible from outside the Class and Instances of the Class, whereas Private members are only accessible from within.

Instance Members are unique to every Instance of the Class, whereas Shared Members are common to all Instances and Shared Members may be referenced directly on the Class itself.
