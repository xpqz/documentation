# PropertyArguments Class

Where appropriate, APL supplies the PropertyGet and PropertySet functions with an argument that is an instance of the internal class `PropertyArguments`.

`PropertyArguments` has just 3 read-only Fields which are as follows:

| `Name` | The name of the property. This is useful when one function is handling several properties. |
| --- | ---  |
| `NewValue` | Array containing the new value for the Property or for selected element(s) of the property as specified by `Indexers` . |
| `IndexersSpecified` | A Boolean vector that identifies which dimensions of the Property are to be referenced or assigned. |
| `Indexers` | A vector that identifies the elements of the Property that are to be referenced or assigned. |
