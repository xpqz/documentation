# Window Captions

The captions of the various windows that comprise the Dyalog Integrated Development Environment (IDE) are user-configurable and defined by entries in the Windows registry in the **Captions** subkey of the main Dyalog key.

Note that this only applies when the windows are floating (un-docked). When a window is docked Dyalog displays a fixed non-configurable caption.

Note also that the **Captions** subkey is not created by the interpreter; the user must create the subkey and the values.

Each entry is a string value whose name identifies the window as follows:

| Window Name | Description |
| --- | ---  |
| Session | The main Dyalog APL session window |
| Editor | The Editor window |
| SysTray | The hint on Dyalog icons in the System Tray |
| MessageBox | The notification Message Box that is displayed in various circumstances; for example, when an object cannot be fixed by the Editor |
| Explorer | The Workspace Explorer tool |
| Rebuild Errors | The dialog box that is displayed if one or more objects cannot be re-instantiated when a workspace is loaded |
| Status | The Status window |
| Event Viewer | The Event Viewer |
| FindReplace | The Find/Replace dialog box |
| ExitDialog | The Exit dialog box that is displayed when the user closes the Session window |
| WSSearch | The Find Objects tool |
| Syserror | The Syserror Message Box |

Each string value should contain a mixture of your own text and keywords which are enclosed in braces, e.g. {TITLE}. Keywords act like variables and are replaced at display time by corresponding values as described in the table below.

| Keyword | Value |
| --- | ---  |
| {TITLE} | The window name shown in the first column of the previous table |
| {WSID} | Workspace ID ( `âŽ•WSID` ) |
| {NSID} | Current Namespace |
| {SNSID} | Current Namespace (short version) |
| {PRODUCT} | The name of the Dyalog product, e.g. "Dyalog APL/W - 64" |
| {VER_A} | The main version number, e.g. "14" |
| {VER_B} | The secondary version number, e.g. "0" |
| {VER_C} | The tertiary  version number (currently the internal revision number) |
| {PID} | The process ID |
| {CHARS} | "Classic" or "Unicode" |
| {BITS} | "32" or "64" |
| {XLOC} | The namespace currently being explored (Explorer only) |

For example, if the Registry contains**.\Captions\Session** whose value is:
```apl
    My APL ({WSID}) Version {VER_A}.{VER_B}[{VER_C}]  - {PID}
```

then the caption displayed in a new Dyalog APL Session window might be:
```apl
    My APL (CLEAR WS) Version 14.0[20105] - 4616
```
