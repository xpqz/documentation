# APL Exit Codes

When APL or a bound .EXE terminates, it returns an exit code to the calling environment. If APL is started from a desktop icon, the return code is ignored. However, if APL is started from a script (UNIX) or a command processor, the exit code is available and may be used to determine whether or not to continue with other processing tasks. The return codes are:

| 0 | Successful `⎕OFF` , `)OFF` , `)CONTINUE` , graphical exit from GUI |
| --- | ---  |
| 1 | APL failed to start. This will occur if there was a failure to read a translate file, there is insufficient memory, or a critical parameter is incorrectly specified or missing. |
| 2 | APL was terminated by SIGHUP or SIGTERM (UNIX) or in response to a QUIT WINDOWS request. APL has done a clean exit. |
| 3 | APL issued a syserror. |
| 4 | Runtime violation. This occurs if a runtime application attempts to read input from the Session. Only a development version has a Session. |
| 5 | APL was unable to load the Conga libraries (14.1.25383 onwards). In 16.0 the RIDE libraries have been included in the Conga libraries. |
| 6 | RIDE_INIT or one of its components was ill-defined, or APL was unable to use the port, and/or unable to resolve the hostname  (14.1.25383 onwards) |
| 7 | Reserved |
| 8 | Windows rejected APL's request to create a session window (in earlier versions this generated a syserror 126) |
| 9 | Dyalog has encountered a Microsoft Windows-related error when starting and is unable to continue. For example it cannot register clipboard formats. |
| 10 | CEF sub-process crash - something has gone unexpectedly wrong with either the HTMLRenderer or CEF sub-processes and cannot continue |
| 11 | Cannot create c-stack (macOS only) |

### Notes:

Under UNIX exit codes greater than 127 indicates (127+signal number) of the untrapped signal which caused the process to terminate.

APL applications can generate  a custom return code by specifying an integer value to the right of `⎕OFF`. Dyalog recommends using values greater than 12 for this purpose.
