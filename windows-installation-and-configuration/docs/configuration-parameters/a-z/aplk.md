# APLK

This parameter specifies the name of your Input Translate Table, which defines your keyboard layout. The keyboard combo in the *Configure* dialog box displays all the files with the .DIN extension in the directory specified by the APLKEYS parameter. You may choose any one of the supplied tables, and you may add your own to the directory. Note that the FILE.DIN table is intended for input from **file** , and should not normally be chosen as a keyboard table.
