# ExternalHelpURL

If UseExternalHelpURL is 1, Dyalog attempts to use the Microsoft Document Explorer and online help, for example from Visual Studio (if installed), to display help for external objects, such as .Net Types. This parameter specifies the URL to be used. In most cases the default setting  will be sufficient. On some configurations it may be necessary to change this. See [ UseExternalHelpURL on page 1](useexternalhelpurl.md).
