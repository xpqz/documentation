# Enable_CEF

This parameter is a Boolean value with a default value of 1. If set to 0, it disables the [Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF)https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_Embedded_Framework.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_Embedded_Framework) and an attempt to create an HTMLRenderer object will fail with an error message.

## Note

Currently the value of the Enable_CEF parameter defined in the Windows Registry or in a
Configuration file is ignored. Only the value set in the command line or as an
environment variable is honoured. If not defined in this way, the default value
is used.
