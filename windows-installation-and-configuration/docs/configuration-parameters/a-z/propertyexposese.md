# PropertyExposeSE

Each workspace contains a flag that specifies whether or the names of Properties, Methods and Events of the Session object are exposed. If set, you may query/set the Properties of`⎕SE` and invoke`⎕SE` Methods directly as if they were variables and functions respectively. As a consequence, these names may not be used for global variables in the`⎕SE` namespace. This parameter determines the default value of the flag in a`CLEAR WS`.

See also [Expose properties of Session Namespace](../../The APL Environment/Configuration Dialog Object Syntax Tab.htm#PropertyExposeSE).
