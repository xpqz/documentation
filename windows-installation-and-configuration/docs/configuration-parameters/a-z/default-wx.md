# Default_WX

This parameter specifies the value of `⎕WX` in a clear workspace. This in turn determines whether or not the names of properties, methods and events of GUI objects are exposed. If set (`⎕WX` is 1), you may query/set properties and invoke methods directly as if they were variables and functions respectively. As a consequence, these names may not be used for global variables in GUI objects.

See also [Expose properties of GUI Namespaces on page 1](../../The%20APL%20Environment/Configuration%20Dialog%20Object%20Syntax%20Tab.htm#Default_WX) and [⎕WX on page 1](../../The%20APL%20Environment/Configuration%20Dialog%20Session%20Tab.htm#Default_WX).
