# ClassicModeSavePosition

This parameter specifies whether or not the current size and location of the first of the editor and tracer windows are remembered for next time. 
 This applies only if ClassicMode is 1.  See [Â ClassicMode](./classicmode.md).

The size and location of the windows are saved in the registry in the subfolder WindowRects/EditWindow and TraceWindow.
