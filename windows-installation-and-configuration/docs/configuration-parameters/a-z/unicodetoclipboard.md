# UnicodeToClipboard

This parameter specifies whether or not text that is transferred to and from the Windows clipboard is treated as Unicode text. If UnicodeToClipboard is 0 (the default), the symbols in`⎕AV` are mapped to ASCII text (0-255). In particular, the APL symbols are mapped to ASCII symbols according to their positions in the Dyalog APL font. If UnicodeToClipboard is 1, the symbols in`⎕AV` are mapped to Unicode text and the APL symbols are mapped to their genuine Unicode equivalent values.
