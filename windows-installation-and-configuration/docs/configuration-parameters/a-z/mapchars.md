# mapchars

In previous versions of Dyalog APL, certain pairs of characters in`⎕AV` were mapped to a single font glyph through the output translate table. For example, the ASCII pipe ¦ and the APL style`|` were both mapped to the APL style`|` . From Version 7.0 onwards, it has been a requirement that the mapping between`⎕AV` and the font is strictly one-to-one (this is a consequence of the new native file system). Originally, the mapping of the ASCII pipe and the APL style, the APL and ASCII quotes, and the ASCII ^ and the APL ^ were hard-coded. The mapping is defined by the mapchars parameter.

mapchars is a string containing pairs of hexadecimal values which refer to 0-origin indices in`⎕AV` . The first character in each pair is mapped to the second on output. The default value of mapchars is DB0DEBA7EEC00BE0 which defines the following mappings.

| From | From | From | To | To | To |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---  |
| Hex | Decimal | Symbol | Hex | Decimal | Symbol |
| DB | 219 | `‘` | 0D | 13 | `'` |
| EB | 235 | `^` | A7 | 167 | `^` |
| EE | 238 | `⌷` | C0 | 192 | `|` |
| 0B | 11 | `.` | E0 | 224 | `.` |

To clear all mappings, set MAPCHARS=0000 .
