# ClassicMode

This parameter specifies whether or not the Session operates in *Dyalog Classic mode* . The default is 0. If this parameter is set to 1, the Editor and Tracer behave in a manner that is consistent with earlier versions of Dyalog APL.

Note that in this mode, a maximum of 50 Trace windows may be displayed.
