# Greet_Bitmap

This parameter specifies the filename of a bitmap to be displayed during initialisation of the Dyalog APL application. It is used typically to display a product logo from a runtime application. The bitmap will remain until either an error occurs, or it is removed using the [GreetBitmap](../../../GUI/MethodOrEvents/GreetBitmap.htm) method of the Root object.
```apl
`Greet_Bitmap=c:\myapp\logo.bmp`
```
