# AutoDPI

This parameter determines whether or not the Dyalog program registers the application as DPI-Aware when it initialises. If 1, (the default), Dyalog performs the auto-scaling; if 0, scaling is the responsibility of the programmer or operating system. See also [Enable DPI Scaling of the interpreter and development environment on page 1](../../The APL Environment/Configuration Dialog General Tab.htm#AutoDPI).
