# PropertyExposeRoot

Each workspace contains a flag that specifies whether or not the names of Properties, Methods and Events of the Root object are exposed. If set, you may query/set the Properties of Root and invoke the Root Methods directly as if they were variables and functions respectively. As a consequence, these names may not be used for global variables in your workspace. This parameter determines the default value of the flag in a`CLEAR WS`.
