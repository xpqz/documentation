# File Associations

During installation, setup.exe associates a number of file extensions with Dyalog applications.

Workspace files with extension .dws and files with extension .dyapp, which are used to bootstrap [SALT-based applications](https://docs.dyalog.com/latest/SALT%20User%20Guide.pdf#page=12), are associated with `dyalog.exe`.

The following file types are associated with the Dyalog APL Editor dyaedit.exe. They are used by various source code management tools, including [Link](https://dyalog.github.io/link/3.0/) and [SALT](https://docs.dyalog.com/latest/SALT%20User%20Guide.pdf) and 3rd party tools like [Acre Desktop](https://github.com/the-carlisle-group/Acre-Desktop/wiki).

| .aplf | Functions |
| --- | ---  |
| .aplo | Operators |
| .apln | Namespaces |
| .aplc | Classes |
| .apli | Interfaces |
| .dyalog | Generic |

Additionally, Link uses .apla files to store serialised arrays. These are likely to become associated with dyaedit.exe in a future release.
