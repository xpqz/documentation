**Applies To**


**Description**


This property specifies a keystroke that, when pressed by the user, will
generate a [Select](../a-z/select.md) event on an object. It
applies to all objects whether or not they possess a "natural" [Select](../a-z/select.md)
 event. You can therefore associate a keystroke with an arbitrary action on any
object you desire.


The Accelerator property is a 2-element integer vector. The first element is
a key number which is the number by which Windows *knows* the key. The
second element is the shift state which is the sum of 1 (Shift key), 2 (Control
key) and 4 (Alt key).


For example, to attach the keystroke Ctrl+A to an object, you would set its
Accelerator to (65 2). To attach the keystroke Shift+Ctrl+F1 (key number 112),
you would set its Accelerator to (112 3). Key numbers may be obtained by
displaying the messages generated by the [KeyPress](../a-z/keypress.md)
 event.


Note that a keystroke used as an Accelerator will **not** generate a [KeyPress](../a-z/keypress.md)
 event.
