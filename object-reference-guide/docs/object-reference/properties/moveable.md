**Description**


This property determines whether or not an object can be moved by the user. It is a single number with the value 0 (object cannot be moved) or 1 (object is moveable). If any of the properties [MinButton](../a-z/minbutton.md), [MaxButton](../a-z/maxbutton.md), [SysMenu](../a-z/sysmenu.md), and Moveable are set to 1, the object will have a title bar. However, an object with a title bar is not necessarily moveable.
