**Description**


Specifies whether or not multiple copies of printer output are collated.


Collate is a single number with the value 0 or 1. If Collate is 1, multiple copies of output are collated separately. If Collate is 0, copies are uncollated on output.


Collate is ignored unless [Copies](../a-z/copies.md) is >1.


The default value for Collate is derived from the current printer setting and Collate is only effective if the printer supports this capability.
