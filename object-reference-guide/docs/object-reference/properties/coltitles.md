<h1 class="heading"><span class="name">ColTitles</span></h1>

AppliesÂ To: [Grid](../a-z/grid.md) [ListView](../a-z/listview.md)


**Description**


This property specifies the headings that are displayed above the columns in a [Grid](../a-z/grid.md) object. If specified, it must be a vector of character vectors or matrices whose length is the same as the number of columns implied by the [Values](../a-z/values.md) property. The default value of ColTitles is an empty character vector. In this case, the system displays "standard" spreadsheet column titles A-Z, AA-AZ, BA-BZ and so forth.


To disable the display of column titles in a [Grid](../a-z/grid.md), you should set the [TitleHeight](../a-z/titleheight.md) property to 0.
