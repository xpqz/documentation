Description


The GridLines property specifies whether or not lines are displayed between items in a [ListView](../a-z/listview.md) object. GridLines applies only if the value of the [View](../a-z/view.md) property is `'Report'`.


GridLines is a single number with the value 0 (no lines are displayed) or 1 (lines are displayed); the default is 0.
