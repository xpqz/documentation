Description


The SelImageIndex property determines which bitmapped images in an [ImageList](../a-z/imagelist.md) correspond to items in a [TreeView](../a-z/treeview.md) object when the item is *selected*. It is an integer vector whose length is the same as the number of items in the object and is `⎕IO` dependent.
