Applies To: [DateTimePicker](../a-z/datetimepicker.md)


**Description**


Specifies the value of date/time in a [DateTimePicker](../a-z/datetimepicker.md).


The DateTime property represents the date and time value that is currently displayed in a [DateTimePicker](../a-z/datetimepicker.md) object.


It is normally a 4-element integer vector containing the date (as an IDN), hour, minutes and seconds respectively.


However, if the checkbox shown in the object is unset (see [HasCheckBox](../a-z/hascheckbox.md)), the value of DateTime will be
`⍬` (zilde).
