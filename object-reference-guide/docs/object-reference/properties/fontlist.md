Description


The FontList property is a read-only property (you cannot set its value) that
provides a list of available fonts.


Its value is a vector (1 per font) of 8-element character vectors, each of
which is as follows :

| `[1]` | Face name (character vector) |
| --- | ---  |
| `[2]` | Character height in "points" (integer) |
| `[3]` | Fixed width or not (Boolean) |
| `[4]` | Italic or not (Boolean) |
| `[5]` | Underline or not (Boolean) |
| `[6]` | Weight (integer) |
| `[7]` | Angle of rotation (integer) |
| `[8]` | Character set (see [CharSet](../a-z/charset.md) ) |

Note that the list of fonts obtained from FontList for a [Printer](../a-z/printer.md) object will include TrueType fonts and printer fonts but will exclude screen
fonts. FontList for [Root](../a-z/root.md) will include TrueType
fonts and screen fonts, but exclude printer-only fonts. The two lists will
therefore (typically) be different.
