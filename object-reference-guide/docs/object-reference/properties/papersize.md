**Description**


The PaperSize property specifies the size of paper to be used for printing


PaperSize may be a character vector containing the name of the paper size (eg. `'Legal 8 1/2 x 14 in'` or `'A4 210 x 297 mm'`) or a 2-element integer vector that specifies the desired height and width of the paper in tenths of a millimetre (e.g. 3556 2159 or 2970 2099).


The default value of PaperSize is the name of the paper size associated with the current printer settings.


You can obtain a list of supported paper sizes from the [PaperSizes](../a-z/papersizes.md) property.
