Description


This property specifies whether or not the APL Session window is displayed when an [OLEServer](../a-z/oleserver.md) object is started by an OLE client.


Its default value is 0 (hide Session).


Note that if [RunMode](../a-z/runmode.md) is `'MultiUse'`, you may not in any way access the *instances* of the object that are being controlled by the client applications, even if only a single client is connected.
