**Description**


The TabJustify property specifies, the positions at which the picture and caption are drawn within each tab or button implemented by a [TabButton](../a-z/tabbutton.md) in a TabControl object.



TabJustify is a character vector that may be `'Centre'`, `'Edge'`, or `'IconEdge'`. Its default value is `'Centre'`.



If TabJustify is `'Centre'`, the picture and caption are arranged in the centre of the [TabButton](../a-z/tabbutton.md).

If TabJustify is `'Edge'`, the picture and caption are together aligned to  the appropriate edge of the [TabButton](../a-z/tabbutton.md) according to the value of Align.

If TabJustify is set to `'IconEdge'`, the caption is drawn centrally and only picture is aligned to the edge.

TabJustify is only honoured if fixed size tabs are in effect.
