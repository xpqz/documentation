Description


This is a Boolean property that specifies whether or not a Question (?) button appears in the title bar of a Form or SubForm. However, this does not apply if the Form has a maximise or minimise button which both take precedence. The user may obtain help by clicking on the Question (?) button and then on a control in the Form. It is up to you to provide the help by responding to the [Help](../a-z/help.md) event on the control. The default value of HelpButton is 0.
