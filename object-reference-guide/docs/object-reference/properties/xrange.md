**Description**


XRange and [YRange](../a-z/yrange.md) together determine a user-defined co-ordinate system. These properties are effective on the object's children which have [Coord](../a-z/coord.md) set to `'User'`.


XRange is a 2-element numeric vector containing the x-coordinate of the top left and bottom right interior corners of the object respectively. See [Coord](../a-z/coord.md) for further details.
