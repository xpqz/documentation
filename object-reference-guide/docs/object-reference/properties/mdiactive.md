**Description**


This property contains the name of the [SubForm](../a-z/subform.md) owned by the [MDIClient](../a-z/mdiclient.md) that is currently active. Only one [SubForm](../a-z/subform.md) may be active at a time. You can switch between [SubForm](../a-z/subform.md)s in an MDI application under program control by setting this property with [`⎕WS`](../../Language/System Functions/ws.htm). You can also do this by generating an [MDIActivate](../a-z/mdiactivate.md) event.
