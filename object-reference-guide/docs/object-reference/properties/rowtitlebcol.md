**Description**


The RowTitleBCol property specifies the background colour of the row titles in a [Grid](../a-z/grid.md) object


RowTitleBCol may be a scalar that specifies a single background colour to be used for all of the row titles, or a vector that specifies the background colour of each of the row titles individually. An element of RowTitleBCol may be an enclosed 3-element vector of integer values in the range 0-255 which refer to the red, green and blue components of the colour respectively, or it may be a scalar that defines a standard Windows colour element (see [BCol](../a-z/bcol.md) for details). Its default value is 0 which obtains the colour defined for Button Face.
