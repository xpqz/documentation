**Description**


RowTreeStyle specifies the visible attributes of the tree displayed in the Row titles of a [Grid](../a-z/grid.md).


The value of the RowTreeStyle property is a character vector chosen from the following :


| `'LinesOnly'` | Only the lines of the tree structure are drawn. |
| --- | ---  |
| `'ImagesOnly'` | Only the images of nodes with children are drawn. |
| `'ImagesAndLines'` | Both lines and images for nodes with children are drawn. |
| `'AllImagesOnly'` | Images for all nodes are drawn. |
| `'AllImagesAndLines'` | Both lines and images for all nodes are drawn. |




The default value, `'ImagesAndLines'`, is illustrated in the first picture below. Other values are displayed in subsequent pictures.
