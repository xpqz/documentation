Description


The PageWidth property specifies the width of the page in a [RichEdit](../a-z/richedit.md) object and is the dimension that is used to apply text wrapping and paragraph formatting to the text in the object. PageWidth is a single integer value specified in Twips.


The default value of PageWidth is 0 which disables text wrapping. You may find it convenient to set PageWidth to the width of the [RichEdit](../a-z/richedit.md) window or to a value that is appropriate for your printer.
