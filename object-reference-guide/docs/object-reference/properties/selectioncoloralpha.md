Description


The SelectionColorAlpha property is a 2-element integer vector that specifies the degree of transparency or shade of the colour that is used to highlight the currently selected block of cells in a [Grid](../a-z/grid.md). See "SelectionColor" on page 1.


The first element refers to the shade to be used  when the Grid has the input focus; the second to when it doesn't. Each element is an integer in the range 0 (invisibly light) to 255 (fully dark).
