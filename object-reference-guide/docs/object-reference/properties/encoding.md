Applies To: [TCPSocket](../a-z/tcpsocket.md)


**Description**


The Encoding property is a character vector that specifies how character data
are encoded or translated.



The possible values are `'None'`,
`'UTF-8'`, `'Classic'`, or `'Unicode'`, depending upon the value of the [Style](../a-z/style.md) property.



Unicode Edition


| Style | Encoding | Description |
| --- | ---  |
| `'Raw'` | 'None' | Not applicable. Only integer data may be transmitted/received. |
| `'Char'` | 'None' | Transmission is limited to characters with Unicode code points in the         range 0-255. Attempting to transmit (or receive) a character outside         this range will cause `DOMAIN ERROR` . |
| `'UTF-8'` | Characters are transmitted/received using the UTF-8 encoding scheme. |
| `'APL'` | 'Classic' | Characters are transmitted/received as indices of `⎕AV` ,         and translated according to the current value of `⎕AVU` .         An attempt to transmit or receive a characters not present in `⎕AVU` will cause `TRANSLATION ERROR` |
| `'Unicode'` | Characters are transmitted/received *as is* (as Unicode code         points). |




Classic Edition


| Style | Encoding | Description |
| --- | ---  |
| `'Raw'` | 'None' | Not applicable. Only integer data may be transmitted/received. |
| `'Char'` | 'None' | Characters (which are represented internally as indices of `⎕AV` ) are         translated to and from ASCII using the Output Translate Table win.dot. |
| `'UTF-8'` | Characters are converted to/from Unicode using `⎕AVU` and transmitted/received using the UTF-8 encoding scheme. An attempt to         transmit or receive a characters not present in `⎕AVU` will cause `TRANSLATION ERROR` . |
| `'Raw'` | 'Classic' | Characters are transmitted/received as indices of `⎕AV` . |
| `'Unicode'` | Characters are converted to/from Unicode using `⎕AVU` and transmitted/received as Unicode code points. An attempt to transmit         or receive a characters not present in `⎕AVU` will cause `TRANSLATION ERROR` . |



The default value of Encoding depends upon the value of [Style](../a-z/style.md) as indicated.  Default values are highlighted thus.  in the above tables.


An attempt to set the value of Encoding to a value not valid for the current [Style](../a-z/style.md),
as implied by the above tables, will cause `DOMAIN ERROR`.


If you change the value of the [Style](../a-z/style.md) property, the value of Encoding will remain unchanged if it is valid for the new
Style. Otherwise it will revert to the default value for the new value of [Style](../a-z/style.md).
