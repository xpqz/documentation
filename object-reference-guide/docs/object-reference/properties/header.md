**Description**


The Header property is Boolean and specifies whether or not a [ListView](../a-z/listview.md) object displays column titles. Its default value is 1. Header applies only if the [View](../a-z/view.md) property is `'Report'`. The column titles are defined by the ColTitles property and their alignment by the [ColTitleAlign](../a-z/coltitlealign.md) property.


Note that Header may only be set by `⎕WC` and may not subsequently be changed.
