**Description**


The LicenseKey property is a character string that contains the license key for an ActiveX control.


If an ActiveX control requires a license key, it must be specified by an application when it creates an instance of the control. Typically, the license key is *required* only by the run-time version of an ActiveX control, and is *made available* to an application by the development version of the control.
