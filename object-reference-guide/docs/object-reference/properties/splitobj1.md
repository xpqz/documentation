The SplitObj1 property specifies the name of, or ref to, one of up to two objects managed by a [Splitter](../a-z/splitter.md) object. The object must be one of the following types:


If the [Style](../a-z/style.md) property of the [Splitter](../a-z/splitter.md) is `'Vert'`, the object specified by SplitObj1 is positioned at (0 0) and sized to occupy the space in its parent to the left of the [Splitter](../a-z/splitter.md), with the [Splitter](../a-z/splitter.md) itself attached to its right edge.


If the [Style](../a-z/style.md) property of the [Splitter](../a-z/splitter.md) is `'Horz'`, the object specified by SplitObj1 is positioned at (0 0) and sized to occupy the space in its parent above the [Splitter](../a-z/splitter.md), with the [Splitter](../a-z/splitter.md) itself attached to its bottom edge.


If SplitObj1 is empty, the [Splitter](../a-z/splitter.md) manages the single object specified by [SplitObj2](../a-z/splitobj2.md) and the space to the left or above the [Splitter](../a-z/splitter.md) is empty or controlled by another [Splitter](../a-z/splitter.md).
