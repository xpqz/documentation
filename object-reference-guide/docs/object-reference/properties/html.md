**Description**


The HTML property is a character vector that specifies the content to be rendered by the [HTMLRenderer](../a-z/htmlrenderer.md) object. Dyalog does not perform any pre-processing of the text nor does it verify that it is properly formed HTML using single-byte  character data, including any necessary escaping and encoding.

#### Note:


Typically, you will need to UTF-8 encode any text outside the Unicode range 0-127.
