Description


This property determines whether or not an object has a "minimise" button. Pressing this button will cause the object to be iconified. Pressing it again will restore the object to its original size. MinButton is a single number with the value 0 (no minimise button) or 1 (minimise button is provided). The default is 1.


Note that MinButton is independent of [Sizeable](../a-z/sizeable.md), i.e. you can define an object that can be minimised but not resized.


If any of the properties MinButton, [MaxButton](../a-z/maxbutton.md), [SysMenu](../a-z/sysmenu.md), and [Moveable](../a-z/moveable.md) are set to 1, the object will have a title bar.
