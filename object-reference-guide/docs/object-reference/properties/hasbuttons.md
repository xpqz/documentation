**Description**


The HasButtons property is a Boolean value and specifies whether or not buttons are shown in a [TreeView](../a-z/treeview.md) object. If HasButtons is 1 (the default) a square button is displayed to the left of each parent item label. If the item is expanded (i.e. is children are visible) the button contains a minus sign. If the item is not expanded, (i.e. its children are hidden) the button contains a plus sign. The user can cause a parent item to expand or collapse by clicking this button.
