AppliesÂ To: [Calendar](../a-z/calendar.md) [DateTimePicker](../a-z/datetimepicker.md)


**Description**


The CalendarCols property specifies the colours used for various elements in the [Calendar](../a-z/calendar.md) object.


CalendarCols is a 6-element integer vector whose elements specify the colours as follows:


| `[1]` | Background colour displayed between months |
| --- | ---  |
| `[2]` | Background colour displayed within the month. |
| `[3]` | Text colour within a month |
| `[4]` | Background colour displayed in the calendar's title |
| `[5]` | Colour used to display text within the calendar's title |
| `[6]` | Colour used to display header day and trailing day text. Header and trailing days are the days from the previous and following months that appear on the current month calendar. |


Each element of CalendarCols may be 0 (which means default colour), a negative singleton that specifies a particular Windows colour, or a 3-element integer vector of RGB values.


Note: At the time of writing, setting the first element of CalendarCols has no effect. Dyalog believes this to be a Windows problem that may be corrected in due course.
