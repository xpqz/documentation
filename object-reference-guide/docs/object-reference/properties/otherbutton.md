<h1 class="heading"><span class="name">OtherButton</span></h1>

Applies To: [ColorButton](../a-z/colorbutton.md)


**Description**


The OtherButton property is Boolean and specifies whether or not the user can select a colour from a [ColorButton](../a-z/colorbutton.md) object using the Windows colour selection dialog box.


If OtherButton is 1 (the default), the final row of the colour selection drop-down contains a button labelled "Other…". If the user clicks this button, the standard Windows colour selection dialog box is displayed, allowing the user to select any colour that the computer can render.


If OtherButton is 0, the button labelled "Other…" is not present and the user is restricted to the choice of colours provided by the [DefaultColors](../a-z/defaultcolors.md) property.
