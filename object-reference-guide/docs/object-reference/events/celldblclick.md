Applies To: [Grid](../a-z/grid.md)


**Description**


If enabled, this event is reported when the user double-clicks a mouse button whilst over a cell in a [Grid](../a-z/grid.md). The purpose of this event is to allow an application to enable some special action on double-click. This event may not be disabled.


The event message reported as the result of [`⎕DQ`](../../Language/System Functions/dq.htm), or supplied as the right argument to your callback function, is a 9 element vector as follows :


| `[1]` | Object | ref or character vector |
| --- | --- | ---  |
| `[2]` | Event | `'CellDblClick'` or 163 |
| `[3]` | Y | y-position of mouse (number) |
| `[4]` | X | x-position of mouse (number) |
| `[5]` | Button | button pressed (number) 1 = left button 2 =        right button 4 = middle button |
| `[6]` | Shift State | sum of shift key codes (number) 1 = Shift key        is down 2 = Ctrl key is down 4 = Alt key is down |
| `[7]` | Cell row | integer |
| `[8]` | Cell column | integer |
| `[9]` | Title index | integer |


The y and x position of the mouse are reported relative to the top-left corner of the [Grid](../a-z/grid.md).


The cell row and column are `⎕IO` dependent


If the user clicks over a row *title*, the value reported for the column is `¯1`, and the value reported for Title index is the index of that row title in [RowTitles](../a-z/rowtitles.md), or, if [RowTitles](../a-z/rowtitles.md) is not defined, the row number. Column titles are handled in a similar fashion.
