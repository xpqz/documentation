<h1 class="heading"><span class="name">GridDelete</span></h1>

Applies To: [Grid](../a-z/grid.md)


**Description**


If enabled, this event is reported when the user presses Delete and there are selected cells in the [Grid](../a-z/grid.md). The default action of the event is to empty the selected cells. You may disable this effect entirely by setting the action code of the event to `¯1`. You may also disable the delete operation by returning 0 from a callback function.


The event message reported as the result of [`⎕DQ`](../../Language/System Functions/dq.htm), or supplied as the right argument to your callback function, is a 4-element vector as follows:


| `[1]` | Object | ref or character vector |
| --- | --- | ---  |
| `[2]` | Event | `'GridDelete'` or 193 |
| `[3]` | Start | 2-element integer vector or matrix containing the row, column address(es) of the top left cell(s) in the selected block(s) |
| `[4]` | End | 2-element integer vector or matrix containing the row, column address(es) of the bottom right cell(s) in the selected block(s) |


Note that the values of Start and End are sensitive to the index origin, `⎕IO`.


If more than one block of cells is selected, Start and End are matrices whose rows identify the start and end cells of each of the selected blocks.
