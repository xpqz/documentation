**Description**


If enabled, this event is reported when the remote end of a TCP/IP connection breaks the connection.


You may not disable or nullify the operation by setting the action code for the event to `¯1` or by returning 0 from a callback function. You may also not call TCPClose as a method or generate this event artificially using `⎕NQ`.


The event message reported as the result of `⎕DQ`, or supplied as the right argument to your callback function, is a 2-element vector as follows :


| `[1]` | Object | ref or character vector |
| --- | --- | ---  |
| `[2]` | Event | `'TCPClose'` or 374 |
