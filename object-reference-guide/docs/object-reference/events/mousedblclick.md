**Applies To**


**Description**


If enabled, this event is reported when the user presses and then releases a mouse button twice within a short space of time. The duration of this time is set through the Windows Control Panel.


The event message reported as the result of [`âŽ•DQ`](../../Language/System%20Functions/dq.htm), or supplied as the right argument to your callback function, is a 6-element vector as follows :


| `[1]` | Object | ref or character vector |
| --- | --- | ---  |
| `[2]` | Event | `'MouseDblClick'` or 5 |
| `[3]` | Y | y-position of mouse (number) |
| `[4]` | X | x-position of mouse (number) |
| `[5]` | Button | button double clicked (number) 1 = left button 2 = right button 4 = middle button |
| `[6]` | Shift State | sum of shift key codes (number) 1 = Shift key is down 2 = Ctrl key is down |


In a graphical object ([Circle](../a-z/circle.md), [Ellipse](../a-z/ellipse.md), [Image](../a-z/image.md), [Marker](../a-z/marker.md), [Poly](../a-z/poly.md) and [Rect](../a-z/rect.md)), the position of the mouse is reported relative to the top-left corner of its bounding rectangle.


If you enable [MouseDown](../a-z/mousedown.md) and [MouseUp](../a-z/mouseup.md) events in addition to MouseDblClick events, double-clicking a mouse button will generate the following sequence of events :

1. [MouseDown](../a-z/mousedown.md)

2. [MouseUp](../a-z/mouseup.md)

3. MouseDblClick
4. [MouseUp](../a-z/mouseup.md)
