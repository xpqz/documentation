Description


If enabled, a [Grid](../a-z/grid.md) will generate a ShowComment event when the user rests the mouse pointer over a commented cell. You may use this event to modify the appearance of the comment dynamically.




The event message reported as the result of `⎕DQ` or supplied as the right argument to your callback function is an 8-element vector containing the following:

| `[1]` | Object | ref or character vector |
| --- | --- | ---  |
| `[2]` | Event | `'ShowComment'` or 223 |
| `[3]` | Cell row | integer |
| `[4]` | Cell column | integer |
| `[5]` | Comment text | character vector |
| `[6]` | Window height | integer, pixels |
| `[7]` | Window width | integer, pixels |
| `[8]` | Tip behaviour flag | (1 = yes; 0 = no) |



A callback function may modify the standard behaviour. You may prevent the comment from being displayed by returning 0 as the result of the callback. Alternatively, you may modify the comment text, its window size, or its pop-up behaviour by changing the appropriate element(s) of the event message and returning the new event message as the result.


Note that if the comment window relates to a row or column *title*, the value reported in element [3] or [4] of the event message is `¯1`.


You may display the comment associated with a particular cell under program control by calling ShowComment as a method. In this case, only the *Cell row* and *Cell column* parameters need be specified. If however, you wish to override the comment text and/or its window size, you may do so (temporarily) by specifying the corresponding parameters. By default, a comment displayed under program control does not exhibit tip behaviour but remains visible until it is explicitly removed using the HideComment method.


Note that a comment will only be displayed if the specified cell is marked as a commented cell.
