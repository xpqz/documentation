**Applies To**


**Description**


If enabled, this event is reported *after* an object has been created.
You may not nullify or modify the event with a 0-returning callback, nor may you
generate the event using `⎕NQ`, or call it
as a method.


The event message reported as the result of `⎕DQ`,
or supplied as the right argument to your callback function, is a 3-element
vector as follows :


| `[1]` | Object | ref or character vector |
| --- | --- | ---  |
| `[2]` | Event | `'Create'` or 34 |
| `[3]` | Flag | 1 = object was created by `⎕WC` 0 = object was created by `)LOAD` , `)COPY` or `⎕OR` |


This event also applies to the Session object `⎕SE` and may be used to fire a start-up function (in the `⎕SE` namespace) when APL initialises.
