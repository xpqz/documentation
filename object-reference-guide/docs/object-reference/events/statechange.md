**Description**


This event is generated by a [Form](../a-z/form.md) or [SubForm](../a-z/subform.md) when the user attempts to change the [State](../a-z/state.md) of a [Form](../a-z/form.md), by minimising it, maximising it, or restoring it from a minimised or maximised state. The event is reported **before** the window changes state. You may prevent the state change by disabling the event (action code `¯1`) or by returning a 0 result from an attached callback function.


The event message reported as the result of [`⎕DQ`](../../Language/System%20Functions/dq.htm), or supplied as the right argument to your callback function, is a 3-element vector as follows:


| `[1]` | Object | ref or character vector |
| --- | --- | ---  |
| `[2]` | Event | `'StateChange'` or 35 |
| `[3]` | Window state | 0 (about to be restored) 1 (about to be        minimised) 2 (about to be maximised) |
