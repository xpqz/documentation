Applies To: [Form](../a-z/form.md) [SubForm](../a-z/subform.md)


**Description**


If enabled, this event is generated when the user attempts to move the thumb in a horizontal scrollbar in a [Form](../a-z/form.md) or [SubForm](../a-z/subform.md). This event occurs only in a [Form](../a-z/form.md) whose [HScroll](../a-z/hscroll.md) property is set to `¯1` and is distinct from the Scroll event that is generated by a [Scroll](../a-z/scroll.md) object. The event may be generated in one of three ways:

- dragging the thumb.
- clicking in one of the "arrow" buttons situated at the ends of the scrollbar. This is termed a small change, the size of which is defined by [Step](../a-z/step.md)[3].
- clicking in the body of the scrollbar. This is termed a large change, the size of which is defined by [Step](../a-z/step.md)[4].

The event message reported as the result of [`⎕DQ`](../../Language/System Functions/dq.htm), or supplied as the right argument to your callback function, is a 4-element vector as follows:


| `[1]` | Object | ref or character vector |
| --- | --- | ---  |
| `[2]` | Event | `'HScroll'` or 39 |
| `[3]` | Scroll Type | numeric |
| `[4]` | Position | numeric |


The value of Scroll Type is 0 (drag), 1 or `¯1` (small change) or 2 or `¯2` (large change). The sign indicates the direction.


The value of Position is the new (requested) position of the thumb. Notice however, that the event is generated **before** the thumb is actually moved. If your callback function returns a scalar 0, the position of the thumb will remain unaltered.
