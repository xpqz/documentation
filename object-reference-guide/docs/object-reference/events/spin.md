Description


If enabled, this event is generated when the user clicks one of the spin buttons in a [Spinner](../a-z/spinner.md) object. The event is reported *before* the value of the Thumb property has been updated. You may disable the operation of the spin buttons by disabling this event. You may selectively prevent the user selecting a particular value by returning 0 from a callback function. You may also return a modified event message as a result in order to set the Thumb property to a different value.


The event message reported as the result of `⎕DQ`, or supplied as the right argument to your callback function, is a 4-element vector as follows :

| `[1]` | Object | ref or character vector |
| --- | --- | ---  |
| `[2]` | Event | `'Spin'` or 420 |
| `[3]` | Thumb value | Integer. The new value of the Thumb property resulting from the user pressing one of the spin buttons. |
| `[4]` | Adjustment | Integer. The amount by which the new value of the Thumb differs from its previous value. |
