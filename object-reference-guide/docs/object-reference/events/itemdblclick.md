**Description**


If enabled, this event is reported when the user double-clicks a mouse button when the mouse pointer is over an item in a [ListView](../a-z/listview.md) or  [TreeView](../a-z/treeview.md) object. This event is reported for information only and may not be controlled in any way using a callback function. Generating the event with `⎕NQ`, or calling it as a method, has no effect.


The event message reported as the result of `⎕DQ`, or supplied as the right argument to your callback function, is a 6-element vector as follows :


| `[1]` | Object | ref or character vector |
| --- | --- | ---  |
| `[2]` | Event | `'ItemDblClick'` or 342 |
| `[3]` | Item number | Integer. The index of the item. |
| `[4]` | Mouse button | Integer. |
| `[5]` | Shift state | Integer. Sum of 1=shift key, 2=Ctrl key, 4=Alt key |
| `[6]` | Position | Integer. Indicates the position of the mouse-pointer within the item. It is either 2 (over the icon), 4 (over the label), 8 (over the line), or 16 (over the symbol). |
