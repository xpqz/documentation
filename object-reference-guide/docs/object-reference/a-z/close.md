**Description**


A Close event is generated when an object is destroyed.



For a [Form](./form.md) or [SubForm](./subform.md), the event may be generated by the user selecting "Close" from its System Menu. In this case, the event is reported **before** the window is destroyed, and you may prevent it from going ahead by associating a callback function which returns a result of 0.



By trapping this event you can control termination of your application in many different ways. For example, you could:

- automatically close all [Forms](./form.md) in your application when the master [Form](./form.md) is closed.
- prevent the user from terminating the application if it is inappropriate at that time.
- display an "Are you sure ?" [MsgBox](./msgbox.md).


Note that although all the object's child GUI objects will also be destroyed, none of the child objects will generate a Close event.



The event message reported as the result of [`⎕DQ`](../../Language/System Functions/dq.htm), or supplied as the right argument to your callback function is a 2-element vector as follows :


| `[1]` | Object | ref or character vector |
| --- | --- | ---  |
| `[2]` | Event | `'Close'` or 33 |
