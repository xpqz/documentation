**Description**


This property specifies the colour used to fill the area between the end of the last column of data and the right edge of the [Grid](./grid.md) and between the bottom row of data and the bottom edge of the [Grid](./grid.md).


GridBCol may be a 3-element vector of integer values  in the range 0-255 which refer to the red, green and blue components of the colour respectively, or it may be a scalar that defines a standard Windows colour element (see [BCol](bcol.md) for details). Its default value is 0 which obtains the colour defined for Window Background.
