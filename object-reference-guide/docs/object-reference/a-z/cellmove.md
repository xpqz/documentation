Applies To: [Grid](./grid.md)


**Description**


If enabled, this event is reported when the user attempts to position the cursor over a cell in a [Grid](./grid.md) by clicking the left mouse button or by pressing a cursor movement key. The purpose of this event is to allow an application to perform some action prior to the user entering a cell,  to inhibit entry to a cell, or to deny exit from the current cell.



The default action is to position the user on the new cell. This action can be prevented by returning a 0 from the callback function attached to the event.



The event message reported as the result of [`⎕DQ`](../../Language/System Functions/dq.htm), or supplied as the right argument to your callback function, is an 8 element vector as follows :


| `[1]` | Object | ref or character vector |
| --- | --- | ---  |
| `[2]` | Event | `'CellMove'` or 151 |
| `[3]` | New cell row | integer |
| `[4]` | New cell column | integer |
| `[5]` | Scroll flag | 0 or 1 |
| `[6]` | Selection flag | 0, 1 or 2 |
| `[7]` | Mouse flag | 0 or 1 |
| `[8]` | Changed flag | 0 or 1 (relates to **current** cell) |
| `[9]` | New value | new value of **current** cell or `⍬` |



The 5<sup>th</sup> element of the event message is 1 if switching to the new cell would cause the [Grid](./grid.md) to scroll.


The 6<sup>th</sup> element of the event message is 1 if the user is moving to the new cell by extending the selection. It is 2 if the user selects an entire row or column (by clicking on a title), which moves the current cell to the first one in the selection.


The 7<sup>th</sup> element of the event message is 1 if the mouse is used to switch to a new cell.


The 8<sup>th</sup> element of the event message is 1 if the user is attempting to move to the new cell from another cell in the Grid having typed in (as if to alter)  the current cell.


The 9<sup>th</sup> element of the event message is the intended new value in the current cell or `⍬` (zilde) if **Changed flag** is 0.


The CellMove event may be used to validate and refuse changes as the user navigates between cells.  See also [CellChange](cellchange.md).


An application can position the user on a particular cell in a [Grid](./grid.md) by calling CellMove as a method. If so, the argument need contain only the **New cell row** and **New cell column** parameters.
