AppliesÂ To: [MDIClient](./mdiclient.md)


**Description**


This method causes the [MDIClient](./mdiclient.md) object to organise the icons associated with any minimised child [Form](./form.md)s into regimented rows and columns. To permit the user to carry out this action, it is recommended that a suitable callback function or expression is attached to a [MenuItem](./menuitem.md) or [Button](./button.md). The callback function or expression should then call MDIArrange.


The MDIArrange method is niladic.
