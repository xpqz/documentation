Description


Specifies whether or not a checkbox is displayed alongside the value in a DateTimePicker.


HasCheckBox is a single number with the value 0 (the default) or 1. If HasCheckBox is 1, the user may set or clear the checkbox to indicate whether or not the date/time displayed in the object is to apply.


If the checkbox is not set, the [DateTimePicker](./datetimepicker.md) is considered to be *empty* (the contents will be grayed out) and the value returned by the [DateTime](datetime.md) property is zilde. Note that HasCheckBox may only be set when the object is created.
