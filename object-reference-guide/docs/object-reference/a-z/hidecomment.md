Description


If enabled, a HideComment event is generated just before a comment window is hidden as a result of the user moving the mouse-pointer away from a commented cell.


The event message reported as the result of `⎕DQ`, or supplied as the right argument to your callback function, is a 4-element vector as follows :

| `[1]` | Object | ref or character vector |
| --- | --- | ---  |
| `[2]` | Event | `'HideComment'` or 224 |
| `[3]` | Row | integer |
| `[4]` | Column | integer |


You may prevent the comment from being hidden by returning 0 as the result of a callback function.


Note that if the comment window relates to a row or column *title*, the value reported in element [3] or [4] of the event message is `¯1`.


Invoked as a method, HideComment is used to hide a comment that has previously been displayed by ShowComment. For example, the following expression hides the comment associated with the cell at row 2, column 1.
```apl
      F.G.HideComment 2 1
```


If HideComment is called with an argument of `⍬`, all comments are hidden.
