**Description**


The GridLines property specifies whether or not lines are displayed between items in a [ListView](./listview.md) object. GridLines applies only if the value of the [View](View.htm) property is `'Report'`.


GridLines is a single number with the value 0 (no lines are displayed) or 1 (lines are displayed); the default is 0.


The picture below illustrate the effect on the appearance of a [ListView](./listview.md) object, of setting GridLines to 1.
