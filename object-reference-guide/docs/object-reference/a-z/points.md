Description


This property specifies the co-ordinates for a graphics object. It may define a single set of co-ordinates, or be a nested scalar or a nested vector each element of which contains a set of co-ordinates.


Each set of co-ordinates may be:

- a  2-column numeric matrix containing y-values in column 1 and x-values in column 2. or
- a 2-element numeric vector whose first element specifies y-values and whose second element specifies x-values. The two elements must be of equal length unless one or both is a scalar in which case scalar extension applies.

For further details, see the specifications for the relevant objects.
