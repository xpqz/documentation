**Description**


This method is used to detach the GUI component from an object without losing the functions, variables and sub-namespaces that it may contain.


The Detach method is niladic.


The effect of this method is to remove the GUI component associated with the named object, leaving behind a plain namespace of the same name. All non-GUI child objects are retained. GUI child objects are either destroyed, or similarly converted to plain namespaces depending upon the values of their KeepOnClose properties.
