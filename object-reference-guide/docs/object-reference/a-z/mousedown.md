**Applies To**


**Description**


If enabled, this event is reported when the user presses one of the mouse buttons. The event message reported as the result of [`âŽ•DQ`](../../Language/System%20Functions/dq.htm), or supplied as the right argument to your callback function, is a 6-element vector as follows :


| `[1]` | Object | ref or character vector |
| --- | --- | ---  |
| `[2]` | Event | `'MouseDown'` or 1 |
| `[3]` | Y | y-position of mouse (number) |
| `[4]` | X | x-position of mouse (number) |
| `[5]` | Button | button pressed (number) 1 = left button 2 = right button 4 = middle button |
| `[6]` | Shift State | sum of shift key codes (number) 1 = Shift key is down 2 = Ctrl key is down |


If you enable this event it is advisable that you ALSO enable [MouseUp](./mouseup.md) events. Otherwise, the slight delay in running your callback function will cause the down and up sequence to be **reversed**.


In a graphical object ([Circle](./circle.md), [Ellipse](./ellipse.md), [Image](./image.md), [Marker](./marker.md), [Poly](./poly.md) and [Rect](./rect.md)), the position of the mouse is reported relative to the top-left corner of its bounding rectangle.
