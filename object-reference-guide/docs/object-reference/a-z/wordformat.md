**Description**


The WordFormat property is identical to the [CharFormat](CharFormat.htm) property except that it is used to apply formatting to the selected word or words in a [RichEdit](./richedit.md) object. If the selection is empty but the insertion point is inside a word, the formatting is applied to the word. See [CharFormat](CharFormat.htm) for further details.
