Description


The CircleToday property specifies whether or not a circle is drawn around the Today date in a [Calendar](./calendar.md) object or in the drop down calendar in a [DateTimePicker](./datetimepicker.md), when the month containing that date is visible.


CircleToday is a single number with the value 0 (a circle is *not* drawn) or 1 (a circle *is* drawn); the default is 1.
