Description


The FileMode property applies only to a [FileBox](./filebox.md) object. It indicates the mode in which the selected file is going to be opened. It is a character vector containing `'Read'` (the default) or `'Write'`. If FileMode is `'Write'`, files listed in the File Selection Box are greyed, although they may still be selected.
