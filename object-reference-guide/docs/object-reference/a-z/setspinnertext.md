Description


If enabled, this event is generated when the user clicks one of the spin buttons in a [Spinner](./spinner.md) object. The event is reported *after* the value of the Thumb property has been updated but *before* the Text property has been changed. You may use this event to set the text in the [Spinner](./spinner.md) dynamically instead of relying on it being updated automatically.


The event message reported as the result of `⎕DQ`, or supplied as the right argument to your callback function, is a 4-element vector as follows :

| `[1]` | Object | ref or character vector |
| --- | --- | ---  |
| `[2]` | Event | `'SetSpinnerText'` or 421 |
| `[3]` | Thumb value | Integer. The new value of the Thumb property resulting from the user pressing one of the spin buttons. |
| `[4]` | Text | The text that is about to be put into the edit field. |


The SetSpinnerText event is designed to allow you to dynamically set the text in the Spinner in response to a spin button. It might be used in circumstances where the set of items you wish to present to your user is not predictable in advance.
