Description


The SocketNumber property is an integer whose value is the Window handle of the socket attached to the [TCPSocket](./tcpsocket.md) object and is generally a read-only property.


The only time that SocketNumber may be specified is when a server replicates (clones) a listening socket to which a client has just connected.
