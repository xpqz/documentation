**Description**


If enabled, this event is reported by a client object just before it is docked in a host object, when the user releases the mouse button.


The event message reported as the result of `⎕DQ`, or supplied as the right argument to your callback function, is a 7-element vector as follows :


| `[1]` | Object | ref or character vector |
| --- | --- | ---  |
| `[2]` | Event | `'DockRequest'` or 482 |
| `[3]` | Host Object | ref or character vector |
| `[4]` | Edge | character vector |
| `[5]` | y-position | number |
| `[6]` | x-position | number |
| `[7]` | Outline rectangle | 4-element nested |


Elements 4-7 of this event message are the same as those reported by [DockMove](./dockmove.md), and the effect of a callback function is identical. See [DockMove](./dockmove.md) for further information.
