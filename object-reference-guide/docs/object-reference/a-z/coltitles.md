<h1 class="heading"><span class="name">ColTitles</span></h1>

| AppliesÂ To: | [Grid](./grid.md) | [ListView](./listview.md) |
| --- | --- | ---  |


**Description**


This property specifies the headings that are displayed above the columns in a [Grid](./grid.md) object. If specified, it must be a vector of character vectors or matrices whose length is the same as the number of columns implied by the [Values](Values.htm) property. The default value of ColTitles is an empty character vector. In this case, the system displays "standard" spreadsheet column titles A-Z, AA-AZ, BA-BZ and so forth.


To disable the display of column titles in a [Grid](./grid.md), you should set the [TitleHeight](TitleHeight.htm) property to 0.
