**Description**


Specifies a custom format for the date/time display in a [DateTimePicker](./datetimepicker.md).



CustomFormat is a character vector that may contain a mixture of date/time format elements and body text. The date/time elements are replaced  by the actual date/time values when the object is displayed. The body text is displayed *as-is*. Note that CustomFormat may only be specified when the [DateTimePicker](./datetimepicker.md) object is created.


The date/time elements are defined by the following groups of characters, notice that they are case-sensitive:


| Element | Description |
| --- | ---  |
| d | The one- or two-digit day. |
| dd | The two-digit day. Single-digit day values are preceded by a zero. |
| ddd | The three-character weekday abbreviation. |
| dddd | The full weekday name. |
| h | The one- or two-digit hour in 12-hour format. |
| hh | The two-digit hour in 12-hour format. Single-digit values are preceded by a zero. |
| H | The one- or two-digit hour in 24-hour format. |
| HH | The two-digit hour in 24-hour format. Single-digit values are preceded by a zero. |
| m | The one- or two-digit minute. |
| mm | The two-digit minute. Single-digit values are preceded by a zero. |
| M | The one- or two-digit month number. |
| MM | The two-digit month number. Single-digit values are preceded by a zero. |
| MMM | The three-character month abbreviation. |
| MMMM | The full month name. |
| t | The one-letter AM/PM abbreviation (that is, AM is displayed as "A"). |
| tt | The two-letter AM/PM abbreviation (that is, AM is displayed as "AM"). |
| yy | The last two digits of the year (that is, 1996 would be displayed as "96"). |
| yyyy | The full year (that is, 1996 would be displayed as "1996"). |



The body text is defined by sub-strings contained within single quotes. For example, to display the current date with the format "Today is: 04:22:31 Tuesday Mar 23, 1996", the format string is defined as follows:
```apl
      CustomFormat
'Today is: 'hh':'m':'s dddd MMM dd', 'yyyy
```




To include a single quote in your body text, use two consecutive single quotes. For example, to produce output that looks like: "Don't forget Mar 23, 1996", CustomFormat should be specified as follows:
```apl
        CustomFormat
'Don''t forget' MMM dd',' yyyy
```



**Note:** Non format characters that are not delimited by single quotes will result in unpredictable display by the [DateTimePicker](./datetimepicker.md) object.
