**Description**


The SplitObj2 property specifies the name of, or ref to, one of up to two objects managed by a [Splitter](./splitter.md) object. The object must be one of the following types:


If the [Style](style.md) property of the [Splitter](./splitter.md) is `'Vert'`, the object specified by SplitObj2 is initially positioned at (0 x), where x is half the width of the parent plus the Size of the [Splitter](./splitter.md), and sized to occupy the space in its parent to the right of the [Splitter](./splitter.md), with the [Splitter](./splitter.md) itself attached to its left edge.


If the [Style](style.md) property of the [Splitter](./splitter.md) is `'Horz'`, the object specified by SplitObj2 is initially positioned at (y 0), where y is half the height of the parent plus the Size of the [Splitter](./splitter.md), and sized to occupy the space in its parent below the [Splitter](./splitter.md), with the [Splitter](./splitter.md) itself attached to its top edge.


If SplitObj2 is empty, the [Splitter](./splitter.md) manages the single object specified by [SplitObj1](splitobj1.md) and the space to the right or below the [Splitter](./splitter.md) is empty or controlled by a second [Splitter](./splitter.md).
