| Applies To: | [Grid](./grid.md) |
| --- | ---  |


**Description**


If enabled, this event is reported by the [Grid](./grid.md) object if the user presses the Cursor Down key, and the current cell ([CurCell](./curcell.md))
is within the last row on the [Grid](./grid.md). The default
action is to append a new row to the contents of the [Grid](./grid.md).
If you attach a callback function to this event and have it return a value of 0,
a new row will not be appended to the [Grid](./grid.md).


The event message reported as the result of [`⎕DQ`](../../Language/System Functions/dq.htm),
or supplied as the right argument to your callback function, is a 3 element
vector as follows :


| `[1]` | Object | ref or character vector |
| --- | --- | ---  |
| `[2]` | Event | `'AddRow'` or 152 |
| `[3]` | Row number | number of the new row (integer) |


An application may insert a new row into a [Grid](./grid.md) by calling AddRow as a method. The argument is a 1 to 7-element array as follows:


| `[1]` | Row number | integer |
| --- | --- | ---  |
| `[2]` | Row title | character vector or matrix |
| `[3]` | Row height | integer |
| `[4]` | Undo flag | 0 or 1 |
| `[5]` | Resize flag | 0 or 1 |
| `[6]` | Title colour | negative integer or 3-element RGB vector |
| `[7]` | Line type | integer |





If you are using default row titles, *Row title* will be ignored and the
rows will be re-labelled with default titles. If you *have* set [RowTitles](./rowtitles.md),
the title you specify will be inserted. If you omit *Row title*, a blank
title will be inserted.


Similarly, if you have not previously set [CellHeights](./cellheights.md),
[ResizeRows](./resizerows.md), [RowTitleFCol](./rowtitlefcol.md) or [RowLineTypes](./rowlinetypes.md), or if you have given
them a scalar value, the corresponding parameter will be ignored. However, if
you have specified [CellHeights](./cellheights.md), [ResizeRows](./resizerows.md),
[RowTitleFCol](./rowtitlefcol.md) or [RowLineTypes](./rowlinetypes.md) to be a *vector*, the number you specify in the corresponding parameter
will be inserted into the appropriate property vector. If you omit *Row height*,
it will be assigned a default value; new values for the other properties default
to 0.


*Undo flag* (default 1) specifies whether or not the addition of the new
row may subsequently be undone by an [Undo](./undo.md) event.


To insert a new row before the first one, you must specify the *Row number* as 1 (or 0 if `⎕IO` is 0). To add a new row
after the last one, you may specify any number greater than the current number
of rows. The data in the new row will be set to 0 if the [Values](./values.md) property is numeric, or to an empty character vector otherwise.
