**Description**


The AnimPlay method plays an AVI clip in an Animation object.


The argument to AnimPlay is a 3-element array as follows:


| `[1]` | Repeat | integer |
| --- | --- | ---  |
| `[2]` | From | integer |
| `[3]` | To | integer |


*Repeat* specifies the number of times the clip is repeated. A value of -1 causes the clip to be repeated indefinitely.


*From* is a 0-based index of the frame where playing begins and must be less than 65536. A value of zero means begin with the first frame in the AVI clip


*To* is a 0-based index of the frame where playing ends and must be less than 65536. A value of -1 means end with the last frame in the AVI clip


The last frame remains displayed until the clip is unloaded using [AnimClose](./animclose.md) or until another clip is loaded.
