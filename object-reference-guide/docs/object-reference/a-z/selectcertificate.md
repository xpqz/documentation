**Description**


This event is triggered when [HTMLRenderer](./htmlrenderer.md) requests a resource from a server that requires a certificate.




The event message reported as the result of `⎕DQ`, or supplied as the right argument to your callback function, is a 7-element vector as follows:


| `[1]` | Object | ref or character vector |
| --- | --- | ---  |
| `[2]` | Event | `'SelectCertificate'` or 848 |
| `[3]` | Index | Integer (see below) |
| `[4]` | Addr | Host address |
| `[5]` | Port | Host port |
| `[6]` |  | `'is proxy'` |
| `[7]` | Certificates | See below |




Certificates is a vector of namespaces, each of which represents an available certificate and contains the following variables:


| Name | Description |
| --- | ---  |
| `DER` | Distinguished Encoding Rules. Character Vector. |
| `Subject` | Namespace (see below) |
| `Issuer` | Namespace (see below) |
| `SerialNumber` | Integer |




The Subject and Issuer namespaces contain the following variables:


| Name | Description |
| --- | ---  |
| `CommonName` | Character vector |
| `CountryName` | Character vector |
| `DisplayName` | Character vector |



The application should respond to this event by selecting a certficate from the list of available certificates reported by the 7th element of the event message. This is done by having a callback function that sets the 3rd element of the event message (Index) to the 0-origin index in Certificates and returns the event message as its result.

#### Example
```apl

     ∇ arg←cb arg
[1]   ⍝ SelectCertificate callback function
[2]    arg[3]←0 ⍝ Select the first certificate
     ∇
```
