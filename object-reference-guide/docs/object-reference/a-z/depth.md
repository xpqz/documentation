Description


The Depth property specifies the structure of the items in a [TreeView](./treeview.md) object. It is either a scalar 0 or an integer vector of the same length as the Items property.



A value of 0 indicates that the corresponding item is a top-level item. A value of 1 indicates that the corresponding item is a child of the most recent item whose Depth is 0; a value of 2 indicates that the corresponding item is a child of the most recent item whose Depth is 1, and so forth.



For example:

| AIRPORTS | DEPTH | Description |
| --- | --- | ---  |
| Europe | 0 | Top-level (root) item |
| UK | 1 | 1st sub-item of Europe |
| London Heathrow | 2 | 1st sub-item of UK |
| London Gatwick | 2 | 2nd sub-item of UK |
| Manchester | 2 | 3rd sub-item of UK |
| France | 1 | 2nd sub-item of Europe |
