**Description**


If enabled, this event is reported when the user drags a file icon or a set of file icons and drops them onto the object. The system takes no action other than to report the event.


Note that the event is only reported if [AcceptFiles](./acceptfiles.md) is set to 1.


The event message reported as the result of `⎕DQ`, or supplied as the right argument to your callback function, is a 5-element vector as follows :


| `[1]` | Object | ref or character vector |
| --- | --- | ---  |
| `[2]` | Event | `'DropFiles'` or 450 |
| `[3]` | Files | Vector of character vectors containing the file names. |
| `[4]` | Item number | Integer. The index of the item within the object onto which the file(s) was dropped. Applies only to objects that have an [Items](./items.md) property such as List, [ListView](./listview.md) and [TreeView](./treeview.md) . |
| `[5]` | Shift state | Integer. Sum of 1=shift key, 2=Ctrl key, 4=Alt key |
