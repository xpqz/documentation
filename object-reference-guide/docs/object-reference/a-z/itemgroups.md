| --- | ---  |


**Description**


This property specifies item groupings for a [ListView](./listview.md) object.


ItemGroups is a nested scalar or nested vector each of whose elements specifies a grouping. Each grouping is a 5-element vector as follows:


| `[1]` | Group caption | character vector |
| --- | --- | ---  |
| `[2]` | Item index | Vector of indices to the Items property that specifies which Items are in this grouping. |
| `[3]` | Caption alignment | an integer: 1 = left aligned caption (the default) 2 = centre        aligned caption 4 = right-aligned caption |
| `[4]` | State | Integer (not yet implemented) |
| `[5]` | Footer text | character vector (not yet implemented) |


Note that State and Footer text are not yet implemented by Windows.


For example, the following expressions executed in the WTUTOR95 workspace will result in the display shown below.
```apl
      'F'⎕WC'Form' 'ListView Object'
      II←⍳⍴COUNTRIES
      'F.L'⎕WC'ListView'COUNTRIES(0 0)(100 100)
                       ('ImageList' 'F.I1')
                       ('ImageIndex' (⍳⍴COUNTRIES))
      'F.I1'⎕WC'ImageList'('Size' 32 32)
      (⊂'F.I1.')⎕WC¨(⊂'Icon' ''),¨↓⍉↑FLAGBITS FLAGCMAP FLAGMASK
      GROUPS←⊂'Europe'(11 4 5 6 7 8 9)
      GROUPS,←⊂'Americas'(12 3 2)
      GROUPS,←⊂'Rest of the World'(1 10)
      F.L.ItemGroups←GROUPS
