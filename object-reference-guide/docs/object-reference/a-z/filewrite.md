**Description**


This method causes the object to be written to the file named in its [File](./file.md) property. For the Bitmap and Icon objects this method will write a file of type .BMP and .ICO to a file with the appropriate extension. If [File](./file.md) specifies any other extension, the method will fail with a `DOMAIN ERROR`:
```apl
 DOMAIN ERROR: This object cannot be saved to this type of file.
```


The FileWrite method is niladic.


If you attach a callback function to this event and have it return a value of 0, the object will not be written to file. You could use this to avoid overwriting an existing file.
