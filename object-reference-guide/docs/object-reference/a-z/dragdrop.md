**Description**


If enabled, this event is reported when the user drops one object (the **dragged object**) onto another (the**target object**). The event is generated by the target object, i.e. the object which is being dropped **on**.


The event message reported as the result of [`⎕DQ`](../../Language/System Functions/dq.htm), or supplied as the right argument to your callback function, is a 7-element vector as follows :


| `[1]` | Target Object | ref or character vector |
| --- | --- | ---  |
| `[2]` | Event | `'DragDrop'` or 11 |
| `[3]` | Dragged Object | ref or character vector |
| `[4]` | Y | y-position of mouse pointer in the target object |
| `[5]` | X | x-position of mouse pointer in the target object |
| `[6]` | H | height of dragged object in the coordinate system of the target object |
| `[7]` | W | width of dragged object in the coordinate system of the target object |
| `[8]` | Shift State | numeric scalar containing the sum of the values associated with the Shift(1), Ctrl(2) and Alt(4) keys when the object was dropped. |


Note that Y, H, X and W are all reported relative to the target object.
