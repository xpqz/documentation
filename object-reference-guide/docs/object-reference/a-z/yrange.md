**Description**


[XRange](XRange.htm) and YRange together determine a user-defined co-ordinate system. These properties are effective on the object's children which have [Coord](coord.md) set to `'User'`.


YRange is a 2-element numeric vector containing the y-coordinate of the top left and bottom right interior corners of the object respectively. See [Coord](coord.md) for further details.
