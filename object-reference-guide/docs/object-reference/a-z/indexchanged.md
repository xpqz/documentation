Applies To: [Grid](./grid.md)


**Description**


If enabled, this event is reported when the value of the Index property of a Grid has changed as a result of user interaction. The event is reported *after* the Grid has been scrolled. You may not modify or nullify the operation with a 0-return callback and you may not call IndexChanged as a method or generate this event using `⎕NQ`. To cause a Grid to scroll, use `⎕WS` to set its Index property.


The event message reported as the result of `⎕DQ`, or supplied as the right argument to your callback function, is a 4-element vector as follows :


| `[1]` | Object | ref or character vector |
| --- | --- | ---  |
| `[2]` | Event | `'IndexChanged` or 210 |
| `[3]` | Row | Integer. |
| `[4]` | Column | Integer. |
