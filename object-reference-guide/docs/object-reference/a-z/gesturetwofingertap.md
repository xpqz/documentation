**Applies To**


**Description**


This event is reported when the user taps two fingers at the same time on an object


The event message reported as the result of [`âŽ•DQ`](../../Language/System Functions/dq.htm), or supplied as the right argument to your callback function, is a 5-element vector as follows :


| `[1]` | Object | ref or character vector |
| --- | --- | ---  |
| `[2]` | Event | `'GestureTwoFingerTap'` or 496 |
| `[3]` | Flags | integer which reports the state of the gesture |
| `[4]` | Location | 2-element integer vector containing the y and x-position respectively of the point midway between the two fingers. These are reported in pixel coordinates relative to the origin (top-left corner) of the object reporting the event.. |
| `[5]` | Distance | 2-element integer vector containing the high and low parts (words) of a 64-bit integer that indicates the distance between the two fingers. |


The Flags parameter [3] which reports the state of the Gesture, is always an integer with the value 5 (**GF_BEGIN+GF_END**).


| Name | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | ---  |
| `GF_BEGIN` | 1 | A gesture is starting. |
| `GF_END` | 4 | A gesture has finished. |


Returning zero from the callback disables any default handling by the operating system.


The associated callback is run **immediately** while the windows notification is still on the stack. See
