<h1 class="heading"><span class="name">ShowInput</span></h1>

AppliesÂ To: [Grid](./grid.md)


**Description**


This property specifies whether or not the cells in a [Grid](./grid.md) are displayed using their associated input objects.



The ShowInput property is either a single Boolean value that applies to all the cells in a [Grid](./grid.md), or it is a vector whose elements are mapped to individual cells via the [CellTypes](celltypes.md) property. A value of 0 means that the corresponding cell is displayed normally. A value of 1 indicates that the cell is displayed using its associated input object, as it is when it is the current cell. ShowInput is relevant to cells displayed using [Combo](./combo.md) and [Button](./button.md) objects.



The example below illustrates the appearance of a [Grid](./grid.md) in which ShowInput is set to 0 for the Job Title column and 1 for the Region and Permanent columns.
