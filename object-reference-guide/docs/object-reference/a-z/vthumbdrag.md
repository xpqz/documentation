<h1 class="heading"><span class="name">VThumbDrag</span></h1>

Applies To: [Form](./form.md) [SubForm](./subform.md)


**Description**


If enabled, this event is generated when the user attempts to drag the thumb in a vertical scrollbar in a [Form](./form.md) or [SubForm](./subform.md). This event occurs only in a [Form](./form.md) or [SubForm](./subform.md) whose [HScroll](./hscroll.md) property is set to `¯1` and is distinct from the Scroll event that is generated by a [Scroll](./scroll.md) object.


The event message reported as the result of [`⎕DQ`](../../Language/System Functions/dq.htm), or supplied as the right argument to your callback function, is a 3-element vector as follows:


| `[1]` | Object | ref or character vector |
| --- | --- | ---  |
| `[2]` | Event | `'VThumbDrag'` or 441 |
| `[3]` | Position | numeric |


The value of Position is the new (requested) position of the Thumb. Setting the action code of this event to `¯1`, or returning a 0 from a callback function attached to it, has no effect.
