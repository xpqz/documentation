Description


This property specifies the headings that are displayed to the left of the rows in a [Grid](./grid.md) object. If specified, it must be a vector of character vectors or matrices whose length is the same as the number of rows implied by the Values property. The default value of RowTitles is an empty character vector. In this case, the system displays the row numbers.


To disable the display of row titles in a [Grid](./grid.md), you should set the TitleWidth property to 0.
