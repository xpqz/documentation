**Description**


The FixedOrder property specifies whether or not the [CoolBar](./coolbar.md) displays [CoolBands](./coolband.md) in the same order.


FixedOrder is a single number with the value 0 (user may re-order bands) or 1 (user may not re-order bands); the default is 0.


If FixedOrder is 1, the user may move bands to different rows, but the band order is static.
