**Description**


The ColTitleFCol property specifies the colour of the column titles in a [Grid](./grid.md) object


ColTitleFCol may be a scalar that specifies a single colour to be used for all of the column titles, or a vector that specifies the colour of each of the column titles individually. An element of ColTitleFCol may be an enclosed 3-element vector of integer values in the range 0-255 which refer to the red, green and blue components of the colour respectively, or it may be a scalar that defines a standard Windows colour element (see [BCol](BCol.htm) for details). Its default value is 0 which obtains the colour defined for Button text.
