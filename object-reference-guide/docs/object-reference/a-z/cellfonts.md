**Description**


This property specifies the font objects to be used to display the [Values](values.md) in a [Grid](./grid.md) object.


CellFonts is either a single ref or a simple character vector, or a vector of refs or character vectors. If it specifies a single font object this will be used to draw the text in *all* of the cells in the [Grid](./grid.md). If it specifies more than one font object, these are mapped to individual cells through the [CellTypes](celltypes.md) property.
