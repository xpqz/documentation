Description


The ReportInfo property is a matrix that is displayed alongside each item in a [ListView](./listview.md) object when its View property is `'Report'`. Each element of the matrix may be a character vector or a number.


The information is displayed in a grid format, the first column of which contains the item labels and their icons. Subsequent columns of the grid are defined by the corresponding columns of ReportInfo. The alignment of the columns is specified by the ColTitleAlign property.
