Applies To: [RichEdit](./richedit.md)


**Description**


The ParaFormat property describes the current paragraph format or the paragraph format of the currently selected text in a [RichEdit](./richedit.md) object. It is a 6-element nested array structured as follows:


| `[1]` | A character vector that specifies the text alignment. This may be `'Left'` (the default), `'Right'` or `'Centre'` |
| --- | ---  |
| `[2]` | The size of the indentation of the first line in the paragraph measured from the left margin in [Twips](../Miscellaneous/Twips.htm) . |
| `[3]` | The size of the horizontal offset of the start of the second and subsequent lines. This is measured in [Twips](../Miscellaneous/Twips.htm) relative to the first line indentation specified in element [2]. |
| `[4]` | The size of the right indentation measured in [Twips](../Miscellaneous/Twips.htm) from the right margin. |
| `[5]` | An integer value specifying the bullet/numbering option. 0 mean no numbering, 1 means bullets. |
| `[6]` | An integer vector specifying the size of any tab stops measured in [Twips](../Miscellaneous/Twips.htm) from the left margin and specified in ascending order. |


If there is no text selected, ParaFormat specifies the *current* paragraph formatting format, i.e. that which will be used to format the current (and subsequent) lines of characters that the user enters. If there *is* text selected ParaFormat specifies the paragraph formatting of the selected block of text. If the format is not strictly homogeneous, `⎕WG` will report the format of the first paragraph in the selected block


`(⎕WS 'ParaFormat' ...)` will set the format of the currently selected block of text. To set the format of an arbitrary block of text you must select it first using `(⎕WS 'SelText' ...)`.
