Description


This method is used to duplicate a row in a [Grid](../a-z/grid.md) object.


The argument to DuplicateRow is a 2, 3, 4 or 5-element vector as follows:

| `[1]` | Source Row number | number of the row (integer) to be duplicated |
| --- | --- | ---  |
| `[2]` | Target Row number | new row number (integer) |
| `[3]` | Comment flag | 0 or 1 (optional, default 1) |
| `[4]` | Lock flag | 0 or 1 (optional, default 1) |
| `[5]` | Undo flag | 0 or 1 (optional; default 0) |


If the *Comment flag* is 1 (the default), any Comments associated with cells in the source row are duplicated in the target row.


If the *Lock flag* is 1 (the default), the lock state of the row is duplicated; otherwise, the new row is not locked.


If the *Undo flag* is 1, the row may subsequently be restored by invoking the Undo method. If this element is omitted or is 0, the operation may not be undone.
