**Description**


This method is used to obtain information about a type list supported by a COM object.


The argument to GetTypeInfo is a single item as follows:


| `[1]` | Type List name(s) | see below |
| --- | --- | ---  |
| `[2]` | Value | (usually) numeric |
| `[3]` | Description | character vector |


*Type List name(s)* is a simple character vector or a vector of character vectors specifying one or more names of type lists supported by the object.


The result is a nested vector with one element per [Type List](../a-z/typelist.md). Each element of this vector is itself a 3-element vector of character vectors made up as follows:


| `[1]` | Name of Constant | character vector |
| --- | --- | ---  |
| `[2]` | Value | (usually) numeric |
| `[3]` | Description | character vector |
