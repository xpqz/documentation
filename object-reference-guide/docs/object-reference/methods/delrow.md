**Description**


This method is used to delete a specified row from a [Grid](../a-z/grid.md) object.


The argument to DelRow is a 1 or 2-element array as follows:


| `[1]` | Row number | number of the row (integer) to delete |
| --- | --- | ---  |
| `[2]` | Undo flag | 0 or 1 (optional; default 0) |


If the *Undo flag* is 1, the column may subsequently be restored by invoking the [Undo](../a-z/undo.md) method. If the *Undo flag* is omitted or is 0, the operation may not be undone.
