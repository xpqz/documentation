AppliesÂ To: [TCPSocket](../a-z/tcpsocket.md)


**Description**


This method is used to transmit a picture represented by a [Bitmap](../a-z/bitmap.md) object to a TCP/IP socket. The picture may be transmitted in GIF or in PNG format.




The argument to TCPSendPicture is a 1 or 2-element array as follows:


| `[1]` | Bitmap name | character vector |
| --- | --- | ---  |
| `[2]` | Picture format | character vector, `'GIF'` or `'PNG'` |


If *Picture format* is omitted, the default is GIF format.



Note that the [Style](../a-z/style.md) of the [TCPSocket](../a-z/tcpsocket.md) object must be set to `'Raw'` before you execute the TCPSendPicture method.


The (shy) result of the method is an integer that reports the number of bytes that were transmitted.

#### Example:
```apl
      S1.TCPSendPicture 'BM' 'PNG'        
4930
```


**Note:** Although PNG is recognised as the latest graphics standard for displaying pictures, not all Web browsers support it.
