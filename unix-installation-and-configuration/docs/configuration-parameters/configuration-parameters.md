# Configuration Parameters

Dyalog can be customised using configuration parameters. These can be set in various ways; if a configuration parameter is set in multiple places the following descending order of precedence applies:

1. command line settings
2. application configuration file settings
3. environment variable settings
4. user configuration file settings
5. built-in defaults

This provides a great deal of flexibility, enabling a user to override one setting with another. For example, a "usual" workspace size (MAXWS) can be defined in the user configuration file, but be temporarily superseded by entering a different value when starting a Dyalog Session from the command line.

For more information on configuration files, see ["Configuration Files"](configuration-files.md). For more information on environment variables, see "Environment Variables".
