# Print Configuration Dialog Box

The Print Configuration dialog box is displayed by the system operation `[PrintSetup]` that is associated with the **File/Print Setup** menu item. It is also available from Edit windows and from the **Workspace Explorer** and **Find Objects** tools.

There are four separate tabs namely **Setup**, **Margins**, **Header/Footer** and **Printer**.

Note that the printing parameters are stored in the Registry in the Printing sub-folder

The specification for headers and footers may include a mixture of your own text, and keywords which are enclosed in braces, e.g. {objname}. Keywords act like variables and are replaced at print time by corresponding values.

Any of the following fields may be included in headers, footers and separators.

| {WSName} | {WS} | Workspace name |
| --- | --- | ---  |
| {NSName} | {NS} | Namespace name |
| {ObjName} | {OB} | Object name |

| {CarriageReturn} | {CR} | Inserts a new-line |

For example, the specification:

Workspace: {wsname} {objname} {rj} Printed {PrintTime} {PrintDate}

would cause the following header, footer or separator to be printed at the appropriate position in each page of output:
