# Saved ResponsesTab

![configuration dialog saved responses tab](../img/configuration-dialog-saved-responses-tab.png)

The **Saved Responses** tab of the **Configuration** dialog is used to remove preferences that the user has previously established.

In the example illustrated above, the user has at some point chosen to save a text file with a .h extension as text in the workspace and, by checking the option **Save this response for all files with a ".h" extension**, saved this as a preference for all such text files. Similarly, the user has checked the option **Do not show this message again** when responding to the warning dialog **Saving as text will ...**.

If the user wishes to reverse these decisions, even temporarily, it is necessary to select the corresponding option /preference name(s) and click **Delete**. The names are intended to be self-explanatory and are not listed here.
